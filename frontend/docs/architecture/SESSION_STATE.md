## Important Decisions Made
1. **Package Manager:** npm (using package-lock.json)
2. **Linter:** ESLint (selected during Next.js setup)
3. **Model Division:** Opus for orchestration, Sonnet for implementation
4. **Git Strategy:** Commits at major checkpoints
5. **Quality Checks:** Added quality scripts to package.json
6. **Schema Approach:** Generated types from live Supabase schema (1200+ lines)
7. **Balance Strategy:** Need to calculate from positions/transactions (no direct field)

## Current Working Directory
```
/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/frontend/wealth-manager
```

## Environment Variables Needed
**Note:** Implementer will need Supabase keys for .env.local:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL (should be http://localhost:54322)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (needs to be provided)
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (needs to be provided)

## Open Questions
None - All technical issues resolved

## Key Discoveries
1. Database schema is much richer than initially planned (12 tables, complex relationships)
2. Account balances must be calculated from positions/transactions
3. Mapping system (map_rules, map_conditions, map_actions) provides sophisticated transaction classification
4. Multiple views available for analytics (transaction_review, position_review)

## Files Created This Session
- `/frontend/docs/DESIGN.md` - System architecture
- `/frontend/docs/ROADMAP.md` - Implementation phases
- `/frontend/docs/API_CONTRACTS.md` - Type definitions

## Next Implementer Actions (Week 4)
1. Implement CSV export for transactions and positions
2. Add PDF report generation for account statements
3. Build global search across entities/accounts/transactions
4. Add date range filtering to all landing pages
5. Implement data quality alerts for stale data
6. Consider performance optimizations for large datasets
