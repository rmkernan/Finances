### User Experience
- **Workflow Enhancement:** Interactive features address real user needs identified in page-by-page review
- **Visual Polish:** Consistent Fidelity green theme and professional UI throughout
- **Accessibility:** Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML maintained

## üéØ **Key Success Factors**

### Process Excellence
1. **User-Driven Requirements:** Page-by-page feature capture vs. assumption-based planning
2. **Foundation-First Approach:** Solid infrastructure enabled rapid feature development
3. **Quality-First Development:** Rigorous quality gates prevented technical debt
4. **Iterative Enhancement:** User feedback integration improved final deliverables

### Technical Achievements
1. **Generic Programming:** UniversalTable<T> supports any data type with full type safety
2. **Reusable Patterns:** EditModal, date utilities, and interaction patterns used across features
3. **Performance Optimization:** Strategic memoization and query optimization throughout
4. **Consistent Architecture:** Established patterns followed across all implementations

## üìã **Next Phase Recommendations**

### Implementation Priority
1. **Day 11 (Document Coverage Map)** - High priority user request with immediate business value
