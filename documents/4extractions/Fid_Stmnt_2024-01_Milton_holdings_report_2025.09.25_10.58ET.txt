EXTRACTION FEEDBACK

What went smoothly:
- Clean, simple statement structure with only two holdings positions
- Clear section organization made data location straightforward
- Standard Fidelity format with well-defined tables and headers
- Income summary properly categorized taxable dividends
- Core Account and Mutual Fund sections followed expected patterns

Sections that were absent (normal):
- No Realized Gains section - no securities were sold during this period
- Limited income categories - only dividends present, no interest or capital gains
- No tax-exempt income - all income was taxable
- No short-term or long-term capital gains distributions

Special observations:
- Statement shows a large withdrawal ($200,000) that reduced account value significantly
- Holdings consist primarily of treasury/government money market positions
- Account maintains minimal core account balance ($2.03) with bulk assets in treasury fund
- Both positions are short-term, liquid investments appropriate for corporate cash management

Classification confidence:
- FIDELITY GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET (SPAXX) → Core Account classification verified
- FIMM TREASURY ONLY PORTFOLIO: CL I (FSIXX) → Mutual Fund Short-Term classification verified

No data quality issues encountered. This extraction represents a straightforward corporate money market account with standard Fidelity statement formatting.
