EXTRACTION FEEDBACK
===================

WHAT WENT SMOOTHLY:
• Document structure followed standard Fidelity format exactly as described in mapping guide
• All holdings data was clearly presented in organized tables on pages 3-4
• Account identification was straightforward with clear account number Z40-394067
• Income summary table was well-structured and easy to extract
• Account mapping worked perfectly - 4067 mapped to "Milton" as expected
• All required fields for each security type were present and clearly labeled
• Bond detail lines contained all necessary CUSIP, ratings, and frequency information
• Yield percentages were clearly marked and formatted consistently

AREAS THAT REQUIRED INTERPRETATION:
• Some fields showed "not applicable" for Core Account cost basis and unrealized gain/loss - correctly converted to null per schema
• Both bonds had "EXTRAORDINARY CALL" features but no specific call dates listed - recorded as bond_features
• Income summary showed no separate line items for short/long-term capital gains - correctly recorded as null
• No "Realized Gains and Losses" section found in this statement - all fields set to null

CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED:
• Minor: Had to carefully distinguish between the two similar municipal bonds with same coupon rates but different maturities and ratings
• Minor: Accrued interest was formatted slightly differently for each bond but clearly identifiable in italics

GUIDANCE DOCUMENT CLARITY:
• The mapping guide was excellent for locating all data elements
• Bond detail line parsing instructions were precise and helpful
• JSON schema specification was clear and comprehensive
• The percentage format guidance for est_yield was particularly helpful (5.100 not 0.051)

AREAS WHERE GUIDANCE COULD BE CLEARER:
• Could benefit from examples of when "Realized Gains and Losses" section might be absent
• More examples of "not applicable" vs null value handling would be helpful
• Guidance on extracting data when some income subcategories are rolled up into totals

DATA QUALITY NOTES:
• All numeric values cross-verified against statement totals
• Account value breakdown percentages verified: 12% + 71% + 17% = 100%
• Income totals verified: Period $1,470.72 + $1,250.00 = $2,720.72 ✓
• YTD totals verified: $29,515.27 + $8,900.00 = $38,415.27 ✓
• Holdings total verified: $58,542.44 + $337,870.33 + $80,658.40 = $477,071.17 ✓

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE: HIGH
All data successfully extracted with high confidence. No manual review required.
