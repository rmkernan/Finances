=== EXTRACTION QUALITY ASSESSMENT ===

ASPECTS THAT WENT SMOOTHLY:
✓ Clear document structure with well-defined activity sections
✓ Bond redemption transactions clearly formatted with REOR references
✓ Core fund activity section provided detailed running balances
✓ Municipal bond interest easily identifiable as tax-exempt
✓ All numeric values and dates extracted accurately
✓ CUSIP codes properly captured for bonds
✓ Account mapping successful (4067 → Milton)

CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED:
⚠ Bond redemption pricing shows "-" rather than actual redemption price
⚠ Some transaction costs are blank/null rather than zero
⚠ Dividend reinvestment shows negative amount (normal but requires careful handling)

AREAS WHERE GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS COULD BE CLEARER:
1. Bond redemption transactions: Guidance could clarify how to handle redemptions where price shows "-" - should this be null or calculated from amount/quantity?

2. Transaction cost handling: Document could specify when to use null vs "0.00" for missing transaction costs

3. Dividend reinvestment transactions: Could provide more explicit guidance on the dual-entry nature (negative reinvestment + positive dividend)

SPECIFIC SECTIONS REQUIRING INTERPRETATION:
1. Core fund activity balance reconciliation - ensured running balances follow transaction sequence
2. Multi-line bond descriptions - concatenated full redemption details including REOR references
3. Dividend reinvestment pairs - correctly linked the negative reinvestment with positive dividend

=== DATA QUALITY VALIDATION ===

RECONCILIATION CHECKS:
✓ Core fund ending balance matches statement: $58,542.44
✓ All settlement dates fall within statement period (Dec 1-31, 2024)
✓ Bond redemption amounts match cost basis values
✓ Municipal interest matches tax-exempt income in summary

COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION:
✓ All 10 pages reviewed for activity sections
✓ No activity sections missed based on document structure
✓ All transaction types present in document captured

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

FOR FUTURE EXTRACTIONS:
1. Consider adding validation rules for bond redemption transactions
2. Standardize null vs zero handling for missing transaction costs
3. Add cross-reference validation between core fund activity and cash movements

FOR DATABASE LOADING:
- Municipal bond interest should be flagged as tax-exempt
- Bond redemptions require special handling for matured securities
- Core fund balances can be used for cash reconciliation
