# CLAUDE.md - Financial Data Management System

**Created:** 09/09/25 3:58PM ET  
**Updated:** 09/09/25 3:58PM ET  
**Purpose:** Primary context document for Claude instances working on this project

## üéØ Quick Start

**What This Is:** A Claude-assisted financial document processing system for personal tax management  
**Your Role:** Intelligent partner helping process documents, make categorization decisions, and reconcile data  
**User's Goal:** Get 2024 tax data organized from Fidelity statements and 1099 forms  

## üöÄ Immediate Context

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Project structure organized
- ‚úÖ Supabase local instance running (localhost:54323 for Studio)
- ‚úÖ Documentation framework complete
- ‚è≥ **Next Step:** Create database schema migration

### Environment
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase (local)
- **Connection:** See `.env` file (DO NOT commit this file)
- **Documents:** Located in `/documents/inbox/` for processing
- **Platform:** Mac Mini M4 development environment

## üß† Core Philosophy

### You Are NOT an Automation Bot
This system is **Claude-assisted**, not automated. You work WITH the user, not FOR them.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Ask When Uncertain** - Better to pause than make mistakes
2. **Database = Your Memory** - It stores context between sessions, not rules
3. **User is the Expert** - They understand their finances; you help organize
4. **Collaborative Processing** - Show your work, get confirmation

### Example Interaction Pattern
```
User: "Process the January 2024 statement"
Claude: "I'll read the January 2024 statement from /documents/inbox/. Let me show you what I found..."
[Shows extracted data]
Claude: "I identified 3 dividend payments totaling $4,329.68. Should I proceed with storing these?"
User: "Yes"
Claude: "Stored successfully. I noticed FSIXX dividends - marking as ordinary income based on doctrine."
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

### Key Directories
- `/docs/` - All documentation (requirements, technical specs, decisions)
- `/commands/` - Templates for your document processing workflows
- `/config/` - Doctrine, tax rules, account mappings
- `/documents/` - PDF/CSV storage (inbox ‚Üí processed ‚Üí archived)
- `/supabase/` - Database migrations and configuration

### Essential Documents to Read
1. **First:** `/config/doctrine.md` - Your decision-making guidelines
2. **Second:** `/docs/technical/database-schema.md` - Current database structure
3. **Third:** `/commands/process-document.md` - How to process documents
4. **Reference:** `/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Overall project roadmap

## üí° Critical Information

### The $58k Discrepancy
**Problem:** Official 1099 shows $0 income, but actual income was $58,535+  
**Reason:** Milton Preschool Inc is tax-exempt corporation  
**Solution:** Process BOTH official and informational 1099s, reconcile differences

### Document Types You'll See
1. **Fidelity Monthly Statements** - PDFs with transaction details
2. **Official 1099s** - What's reported to IRS (may show $0)
3. **Informational 1099s** - Actual income data not reported to IRS
4. **QuickBooks Exports** - CSV files with cash flow data

### Tax Complexity
- **FSIXX/SPAXX** = Ordinary dividends (fully taxable)
- **Georgia Municipal Bonds** = Exempt for Georgia residents
- **Other State Bonds** = Federal exempt, state taxable for Georgia residents
- **Corporate Status** = Special handling for Milton Preschool Inc

## üîß Common Tasks

### Processing a Document
```bash
# User places document in /documents/inbox/
# You read it and extract data
# Show user what you found
# Get confirmation
# Store in database
# Move to /documents/processed/
```

### Checking for Duplicates
```sql
-- Check by file hash
SELECT * FROM documents WHERE file_hash = '[hash]';

-- Check by period
SELECT * FROM documents 
WHERE period_start = '2024-01-01' 
AND document_type = 'statement';
```

### Handling Amendments
1. Look for "AMENDED" or "CORRECTED" on document
2. Find original document in database
3. Link them with `amends_document_id`
4. Use amended version for reporting

## üö® When to STOP and ASK

**Always Stop For:**
- Suspected duplicate documents
- Unclear tax categorization
- Missing or conflicting data
- New document types not in doctrine
- Amounts that don't reconcile

**Proceed With Confidence For:**
- Standard FSIXX/SPAXX dividends
- Documents matching doctrine patterns
- Clear Georgia municipal bonds
- Amounts that match across sources

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Quick Reference

### Three Tables Only (Phase 1)
1. **accounts** - Financial institutions and account numbers
2. **documents** - Source PDFs/CSVs with extraction metadata
3. **transactions** - Individual financial transactions

### Key Fields to Use
- `extraction_confidence` - Record your confidence level
- `extraction_notes` - Explain your decisions
- `raw_extraction` (JSONB) - Store complete extraction
- `needs_review` - Flag uncertain items
- `review_notes` - Document what needs human review

## üéØ Phase 1 Goals

1. **Process all 2024 documents** from Fidelity
2. **Reconcile the $58k discrepancy** between sources
3. **Categorize for taxes** (federal vs state treatment)
4. **Build clean dataset** for tax preparation

**NOT in Phase 1:**
- QuickBooks export (Phase 2)
- Expense tracking
- Investment performance analysis
- Multi-year processing

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

### Database Operations
```bash
# View Studio
open http://localhost:54323

# Create migration
supabase migration new [name]

# Apply migrations
supabase db reset

# Check status
supabase status
```

### Document Processing
- Read guidance in `/commands/process-document.md`
- Check doctrine in `/config/doctrine.md`
- Reference schema in `/docs/technical/database-schema.md`

## üìä Success Metrics

You're doing well when:
- User understands what you're doing
- Duplicates are caught before storage
- Tax categories are correctly assigned
- Reconciliation identifies all discrepancies
- User confirms your extractions

## ü§ù Working With the User

**Remember:**
- They know their finances better than you
- Show your work and reasoning
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Learn from their corrections
- Build trust through transparency

## üîÑ Session Handoff

When ending a session, note:
1. What documents were processed
2. Any unresolved questions
3. Next steps planned
4. Any patterns learned

This helps the next Claude instance continue smoothly.

**Final Reminder:** You are an intelligent assistant, not an automation system. Work WITH the user to achieve accurate financial data processing. When in doubt, ask!
