# Process-Inbox Testing Handoff

**Created:** 09/29/25 7:10PM ET
**Updated:** 09/29/25 7:20PM ET - Steps 3-5 testing complete, ready for end-to-end validation
**Status:** Steps 1-5 validated via automated testing, ready for live sub-agent test
**Your Role:** Continue systematic testing and iteration of the `/process-inbox` command

## üéØ The Big Picture

**Goal:** Create a token-efficient document processing workflow where an orchestrator Claude:
1. Analyzes a multi-account Fidelity statement (30 pages)
2. Trims extraneous pages (cover pages, legal disclaimers, cash flow projections)
3. Maps page ranges for each account's holdings and activities
4. Passes targeted page ranges to sub-agents (e.g., "extract holdings from pages 1-12 only")
5. Sub-agents produce consolidated JSON (all accounts in one file)

**Why this matters:**
- **Original approach:** Sub-agent reads all 30 pages for each extraction (massive token usage)
- **New approach:** Sub-agent reads only relevant pages (60-90% token reduction)
- **Example:** KernBrok holdings extraction reads 12 pages instead of 30

## üé≠ Your Mission

**Test the restructured `/process-inbox` command and iterate until it works reliably.**

Use this pattern:
1. **Test** a step with an automated general-purpose agent
2. **Identify** what broke or was confusing
3. **Fix** the command document
4. **Commit** with clear notes
5. **Repeat** for next step

**Testing methodology:** Launch general-purpose agents to execute specific steps, observe their behavior, gather feedback, and improve the command based on what they struggle with.

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### Command Restructure (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Replaced "Quick Assessment" (2-step: pages 1-2, then full doc) with single-pass "Document Structure Analysis" (full doc once)
- ‚úÖ Added PDF trimming with criteria-based guidance (not fixed page numbers)
- ‚úÖ Added mental page offset verification (prevents re-reading PDF to verify trimming)
- ‚úÖ Changed to consolidated extraction (one JSON per statement, all accounts together)
- ‚úÖ Fixed critical issue: clarified account-level summary pages (with "Account # XXXXX" headers) must be kept

### Testing Completed (Steps 1-2)

**‚úÖ Step 1 (Document Analysis):** Test agent successfully analyzed 30-page Fidelity statement
- Correctly identified 2 accounts (Z24-527872 KernBrok, Z27-375656 KernCMA)
- Properly mapped page ranges for holdings and activities for both accounts
- Recommended excluding 9 pages (cover pages 1-3, cash flow pages 20-21 & 26-27, legal disclaimers 27-30)
- **Feedback:** Instructions were clear, section markers were easy to identify

**‚úÖ Step 2 (Trimming + Validation):** Test agent successfully calculated page offsets mentally
- Mental verification worked correctly without re-reading PDF
- Final page map: 21 pages with accurate ranges
  - KernBrok Holdings: pages 1-12 (originally 4-15)
  - KernBrok Activities: pages 13-17 (originally 16-20)
  - KernCMA Holdings: pages 18-20 (originally 22-24)
  - KernCMA Activities: page 21 (originally 25)
- **Feedback:** Offset calculation was straightforward and systematic

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **CRITICAL - Account summary pages were being trimmed:**
   - **Problem:** Pages 4 and 22 (account-level summaries with Net Account Value) were being removed with cover pages
   - **Fix:** Added explicit guidance: "Rule of thumb: If page has 'Account # XXXXX' header at top, KEEP IT"
   - **Result:** Test agent now correctly keeps all account-level pages

2. **Portfolio summary confusion:**
   - **Problem:** Unclear if pages 1-3 (portfolio-level aggregations) were needed
   - **Research:** Verified these pages aggregate account-level data, but are NOT required for extraction
   - **Decision:** Safe to trim pages 1-3 (account-level pages contain all required data)

3. **User caught data loss:**
   - **Problem:** Live orchestrator trimmed page 4 which contained Account 1 summary (Net Account Value, Income Summary, Realized Gains)
   - **Impact:** Would have lost critical document-level data for holdings extraction
   - **Fix:** Same as issue #1 above

## ‚úÖ Testing Completed (09/29/25 7:20PM ET)

### Steps 3-5 Validated via Automated Testing

**‚úÖ Step 3 (Staging):** Test agent successfully completed account resolution and staging
- Correctly extracted last 4 digits of account numbers for lookup keys (7872, 5656)
- Successfully looked up both accounts in account-mappings.json
- Generated correct filename: `Fid_Stmnt_2025-04_KernBrok+KernCMA.pdf`
- Determined correct staging path: `/documents/2staged/`
- **Feedback:** Instructions clear after adding explicit account key extraction rule

**‚úÖ Step 4 (Present Findings):** Test agent formatted findings correctly
- Followed presentation template exactly with all required sections
- Included complete page map with trimmed PDF page numbers
- Presented correct user options (Holdings/Activities/Both/Something else)
- Used proper formatting with checkmarks and clear structure
- **Feedback:** Template very detailed and easy to follow

**‚úÖ Step 5 (Extraction Prompt):** Test agent constructed prompt accurately
- Built complete prompt following holdings template format
- Included page map with clear account-to-page-range mapping
- Specified "extract ALL accounts into one JSON file" prominently
- Used **trimmed PDF page numbers** correctly (1-12, 18-20 vs original 4-15, 22-24)
- Included all required elements (MD5, source path, extraction mode, output format)
- **Feedback:** Very clear and prescriptive, could proceed confidently

### Issues Found and Fixed (Commit c3540b2)

1. **Account key extraction not explicit:**
   - Added rule: "Use last 4 digits of account number" with example
   - Location: Step 3, lines 178-180

2. **Page number ambiguity (CRITICAL):**
   - Added "(trimmed PDF page numbers)" clarifier to all templates
   - Updated all example page numbers to reflect trimmed PDF numbering
   - Locations: Step 4 presentation template, Step 5 holdings template, Step 5 activities template

3. **MD5 hash placeholder unclear:**
   - Changed from hardcoded example to "[use value from Step 2 validation]"
   - Location: Step 4 presentation template

4. **Excluded pages wording improved:**
   - Changed to "EXCLUDED FROM ORIGINAL: pages 1-3, 27-30 (removed during trimming)"
   - More explicit about which pages from original document were removed

## üîÑ What's Next

### Immediate Testing Needed

**‚è≠Ô∏è End-to-End Live Test:**
- Run `/process-inbox` with a real orchestrator Claude
- Let it complete Steps 1-5 naturally
- When it shows the extraction prompt, verify it matches templates
- **Approve and let it invoke fidelity-statement-extractor**
- Analyze JSON output for correctness
- **CRITICAL QUESTION:** Does sub-agent correctly interpret trimmed page numbers?

### Known Gaps
- [ ] Sub-agent hasn't been tested with the new consolidated page map format yet
- [ ] Database loading hasn't been tested with consolidated JSON format (one file with multiple accounts)
- [ ] Activities extraction hasn't been tested at all (only holdings workflow validated so far)
- [ ] No test for statements with 3+ accounts

## üß™ How to Continue Testing

### Recommended Approach: Step-by-Step Automated Testing

**Test Step 3-4 (Staging + Present Findings):**
```
Use Task tool with general-purpose agent:

"Test Steps 3-4 of /process-inbox command.

Read: /.claude/commands/process-inbox.md

Context from Step 2:
- Trimmed PDF: 21 pages (removed 1-3, 20-21, 26-30)
- Accounts: Z24-527872 (KernBrok), Z27-375656 (KernCMA)
- Page map verified:
  - KernBrok Holdings: pages 1-12
  - KernBrok Activities: pages 13-17
  - KernCMA Holdings: pages 18-20
  - KernCMA Activities: page 21

Execute Step 3 (Account Resolution & Staging):
1. Look up accounts in /config/account-mappings.json
2. Generate correct filename
3. Stage file (simulate - don't actually move)

Execute Step 4 (Present Findings):
1. Format findings per command template
2. Include complete page map
3. Present options

STOP after Step 4 and report:
1. What filename did you generate?
2. Did you present findings in correct format?
3. Were instructions clear?
4. Any issues?"
```

**Then Test Step 5 (Extraction Prompt):**
```
Use Task tool with general-purpose agent:

"Test Step 5 prompt construction only.

Context: You've staged Fid_Stmnt_2025-04_KernBrok+KernCMA.pdf (21 pages trimmed).
User chose: Extract holdings (all accounts)

Your task:
1. Read Step 5 in /.claude/commands/process-inbox.md
2. Construct the prompt you would send to fidelity-statement-extractor
3. DO NOT invoke the agent - just show the prompt

Report:
1. Show your constructed prompt
2. Does it include the page map?
3. Does it say to extract ALL accounts?
4. Does it use trimmed page numbers (1-12) or original (4-15)?
5. Were instructions clear?"
```

### Alternative: End-to-End Live Test

If you want to test the full workflow including actual extraction:

1. Start a fresh Claude session
2. Run: `/process-inbox`
3. Let it proceed through Steps 1-4
4. When it asks what to do, say: `Extract holdings (all accounts - one JSON file)`
5. Review the prompt it shows you before it invokes the sub-agent
6. Let it invoke the fidelity-statement-extractor
7. Analyze the JSON output for correctness

## üìÅ Files Modified (Committed)

**Commit:** `38d96af` - "feat(process-inbox): Major workflow restructure with single-pass analysis and page mapping"

- `.claude/commands/process-inbox.md` - Complete restructure of Steps 1-5
- `.claude/settings.json` - Added bash command permissions for testing:
  - `python3 <<` (heredoc support)
  - `ls`, `md5`, `grep`, `mv`, `awk`, `find`
  - `PGPASSWORD=postgres psql`

## üìÇ Test Artifacts (Not Committed)

- `documents/4extractions/Fid_Stmnt_2025-04_KernBrok_TEST_B_TEXT_holdings_*.json` - Test extraction from earlier experiment
- There may be a 22-page trimmed PDF in `/documents/2staged/` from the live orchestrator test

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Mental verification is effective:** Test agent successfully recalculated page offsets without re-reading PDF - saves tokens and time
2. **"Account # XXXXX" rule works:** Simple heuristic prevents critical data loss
3. **Directive > Prescriptive:** Telling Claude "what to find" works better than rigid code templates
4. **Testing in steps reveals issues early:** Caught account summary trimming before it caused extraction failures
5. **User as safety monitor:** Human review caught data loss that test agent didn't flag
6. **Automated testing validates clarity:** Using general-purpose agents to test each step exposes ambiguities that manual reading misses
7. **Page number context critical:** Trimmed vs original page numbers must be explicit - sub-agents won't have context to figure it out
8. **Explicit examples prevent inference errors:** Account key extraction (last 4 digits) seemed obvious but agents needed it stated
9. **Template completeness matters:** Detailed, prescriptive templates enable confident execution without clarifying questions

## üîç Test File Location

**Sample statement for testing:**
`/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/documents/1inbox/Fid_Stmnt_2025-04_KernBrok+KernCMA.pdf`

- Original: 30 pages
- 2 accounts (Z24-527872 KernBrok, Z27-375656 KernCMA)
- Should trim to: 21 pages
- Good test case: Multi-account, diverse security types, multiple activity sections

## ‚ùì Questions to Answer

As you test, answer these:

1. **Page number ambiguity:** When orchestrator tells sub-agent "extract from pages 1-12", does sub-agent know these are trimmed PDF page numbers?
2. **Consolidated JSON format:** Does sub-agent understand "extract ALL accounts into one JSON file"? Check the fidelity-statement-extractor agent definition.
3. **Activities workflow:** Does the same page mapping approach work for activities extraction, or does it need adjustments?
4. **Error handling:** What happens if trimming removes a page that sub-agent needs?

## üöÄ Quick Start Command

To pick up where we left off:

```
Read /.claude/TESTING_HANDOFF.md for context, then test Steps 3-4 of the /process-inbox command using automated agents. Start by testing Step 3 (Staging) to verify filename generation and account mapping lookups work correctly.
```
