# Data Pipeline Alignment Validation Task

**Created:** 09/29/25 8:45PM ET
**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation of field name and structure alignment across the extraction-to-database pipeline for both Activities and Positions data.

## üéØ Task Objective

Validate that JSON field names produced by extraction agents align with database schema column names, ensuring the loader can successfully map extracted data to database tables without field name mismatches or data loss.

## üìã Validation Scope

You will validate alignment across 4 stages of the data pipeline for TWO data types:

### Activities Data Pipeline:
1. **Mapping Guide:** `/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/config/institution-guides/Map_Stmnt_Fid_Activities.md`
2. **JSON Spec:** `/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/config/institution-guides/JSON_Stmnt_Fid_Activities.md`
3. **Actual JSON Output:** `/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/documents/4extractions/Fid_Stmnt_2025-04_KernBrok+KernCMA_activities_2025.09.29_15.45ET.json`
4. **Database Schema:** `/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/docs/Design/Database/schema.md` (focus on `transactions` table)

### Positions Data Pipeline:
1. **Mapping Guide:** `/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/config/institution-guides/Map_Stmnt_Fid_Positions.md`
2. **JSON Spec:** `/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/config/institution-guides/JSON_Stmnt_Fid_Positions.md`
3. **Actual JSON Output:** `/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/documents/4extractions/Fid_Stmnt_2025-04_KernBrok+KernCMA_holdings_2025.09.29_15.42ET.json`
4. **Database Schema:** `/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/docs/Design/Database/schema.md` (focus on `positions` table)

## üîç Validation Methodology

### Step 1: Read All Source Documents

Read all 8 files listed above completely. You need to understand:
- What field names the Mapping Guides specify for extraction
- What field names the JSON Specs define as output structure
- What field names actually appear in the JSON output files
- What column names exist in the database schema tables

### Step 2: Extract Field Inventories

For each data type (Activities and Positions), create comprehensive field inventories:

**A. Mapping Guide Field Inventory**
- List every field name mentioned in the mapping guide
- Note which PDF section each field comes from
- Note any special handling instructions (e.g., "extract exactly as shown", "calculate from X and Y")

**B. JSON Spec Field Inventory**
- List every field name defined in the JSON specification
- Note whether field is required or optional
- Note the data type (string, number, boolean, date, etc.)
- Note any nested structure (e.g., fields within arrays or objects)

**C. Actual JSON Output Field Inventory**
- List every field name present in the actual JSON file
- Note the data type of actual values
- Note any fields that appear in JSON but weren't in the spec
- Note any fields missing from JSON that were in the spec

**D. Database Schema Column Inventory**
- List every column name in the target table
- Note the data type and constraints (NOT NULL, etc.)
- Note any foreign key relationships
- Note any columns that have default values or are auto-generated

### Step 3: Cross-Reference Analysis

For each data type, perform comprehensive cross-referencing:

#### 3A. Mapping Guide ‚Üí JSON Spec Alignment
Compare field names between Mapping Guide and JSON Spec:
- **Perfect Matches:** Fields with identical names in both documents
- **Name Mismatches:** Fields that exist in both but with different names (e.g., "security_description" vs "sec_description")
- **Missing in Spec:** Fields mentioned in Mapping Guide but not defined in JSON Spec
- **Extra in Spec:** Fields defined in JSON Spec but not mentioned in Mapping Guide

For each mismatch or discrepancy:
- Identify the exact field names in each document
- Quote relevant sections from both documents
- Assess severity: CRITICAL (data loss risk), WARNING (inconsistency), INFO (documentation gap)

#### 3B. JSON Spec ‚Üí Actual JSON Alignment
Compare field names between JSON Spec and actual JSON output:
- **Perfect Matches:** Fields that appear exactly as specified
- **Name Mismatches:** Fields with different names (e.g., spec says "total_deposits" but JSON has "total_dep")
- **Missing in Output:** Required fields from spec not present in actual JSON
- **Extra in Output:** Fields in JSON that weren't specified
- **Type Mismatches:** Fields where data type differs from spec (e.g., spec says string, JSON has number)

For each issue:
- Show the specific field path in the JSON (e.g., `accounts[0].securities_bought_sold[*].settlement_date`)
- Quote the spec requirement
- Show what the actual JSON contains
- Assess impact on database loading

#### 3C. Actual JSON ‚Üí Database Schema Alignment
Compare field names in JSON output to database column names:
- **Perfect Matches:** JSON fields that map directly to columns with same name
- **Name Mismatches:** JSON fields that must be renamed to match database columns
- **Missing Mappings:** Database columns with no corresponding JSON field (may need defaults or derivation)
- **Unmapped JSON Fields:** JSON fields with no corresponding database column (may be metadata only)
- **Type Mismatches:** JSON fields with incompatible types for target columns

For each alignment issue:
- Show the JSON field path and example value
- Show the database column name and type
- Identify whether this is a naming issue, missing field, or type conversion issue
- Specify what transformation the loader needs to perform
- Flag if this will cause loading failures

### Step 4: Section-Level Structure Validation

For Activities data specifically, validate that all activity section types align:

**JSON Sections** (from actual output):
- `securities_bought_sold`
- `dividends_interest_income`
- `short_activity`
- `other_activity_in`
- `other_activity_out`
- `deposits`
- `withdrawals`
- `exchanges_in`
- `exchanges_out`
- `fees_charges`
- `core_fund_activity`
- `trades_pending_settlement`

Validate:
1. Does the JSON spec define all these section types?
2. Does the database have a way to distinguish between section types? (e.g., a `source` column or `transaction_type` column)
3. If sections map to a single `transactions` table, how does the loader know which section each transaction came from?
4. Are there section-level totals that need validation? (e.g., `total_sec_bot`, `total_sec_sold`)

For Positions data specifically, validate that all position categories align:

**JSON Categories** (from actual output):
- Core accounts
- Mutual funds
- Stocks
- Bonds
- Options
- ETFs/ETPs

Validate:
1. Does the database schema support categorization?
2. How are security types distinguished in the database?
3. Are there category-level totals or aggregations that need special handling?

### Step 5: Data Type and Constraint Validation

For each field-to-column mapping, validate:

**Numeric Fields:**
- Precision requirements (e.g., 6 decimals for quantities, 5 for prices)
- Range constraints (e.g., amounts can be negative for debits)
- Whether NULLs are allowed

**String Fields:**
- Maximum length constraints
- Special characters handling (e.g., security descriptions with parentheses, dashes)
- Encoding issues (e.g., unicode characters in names)

**Date Fields:**
- Format in JSON (e.g., "2025-04-30", "04/30/2025")
- Expected format in database (DATE type, TIMESTAMP type)
- Timezone handling

**Boolean Fields:**
- Representation in JSON (true/false, 1/0, "yes"/"no")
- Database column type (BOOLEAN, INTEGER, etc.)

### Step 6: Identify Critical Loading Blockers

Flag issues that will prevent database loading:

**BLOCKER Priority Issues:**
- Required database columns with no corresponding JSON field
- JSON field names that don't match any database column (and can't be automatically mapped)
- Data type incompatibilities that can't be automatically converted
- Foreign key references that can't be resolved (e.g., account_id lookup)

**WARNING Priority Issues:**
- Optional database columns with no JSON field (may need defaults)
- Field name inconsistencies that require explicit mapping configuration
- Precision mismatches that might cause rounding errors
- Missing section identifiers that make transaction classification ambiguous

**INFO Priority Issues:**
- Documentation inconsistencies (field described differently in different docs)
- Extra JSON fields that won't be loaded but aren't harmful
- Metadata fields that are extraction-only (not meant for database)

```

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your validation is complete when:
1. ‚úÖ All 8 source files have been read completely
2. ‚úÖ Every field in every JSON file has been cross-referenced against specs and schema
3. ‚úÖ Every database column has been checked for a JSON source
4. ‚úÖ All misalignments are documented with severity and recommendations
5. ‚úÖ The report clearly states whether loading can proceed
6. ‚úÖ Specific actionable recommendations are provided for any blockers
7. ‚úÖ Complete field mapping tables are provided for loader implementation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Guidance

**Be Extremely Thorough:**
- Don't just check top-level fields - check nested fields in arrays and objects
- Don't just check one example - check multiple records to find inconsistencies
- Don't assume fields with similar names are the same - verify exact matches
- Don't skip optional fields - they may still have alignment issues

**Be Specific in Recommendations:**
- Bad: "Field names don't match"
- Good: "JSON field `sec_description` must be mapped to database column `security_description` in transactions table"

**Quote Evidence:**
- When you find a mismatch, quote the relevant text from both documents
- Show actual JSON examples that demonstrate the issue
- Reference specific line numbers or section headings in documents

**Assess Real Impact:**
- Don't just list differences - explain what will happen if not fixed
- Distinguish between "will cause loading failure" vs "might cause data quality issues" vs "just documentation inconsistency"

## üöÄ Execution Instructions

1. Read this entire task document carefully
2. Read all 8 source files completely
3. Take detailed notes as you build field inventories
4. Systematically cross-reference as described
5. Generate the comprehensive report
6. Save the report to: `/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/.claude/reports/data_pipeline_alignment_report_[timestamp].md`
