**Created:** 09/25/25 1:42AM ET
**Updated:** 09/25/25 1:46AM ET - Added comprehensive database connectivity troubleshooting section
**Purpose:** Implementation of production-ready financial dashboard with comprehensive charts and real data integration

## Context for Claude

This is a cleaned transcript of a conversation about implementing Week 1 + Day 5 of a Personal Wealth Manager frontend dashboard. All git operations, compilation error debugging cycles, and repetitive troubleshooting were removed to focus on the working solution and testing context. Despite gaps, all essential technical context is preserved for continuation.

You've completed Week 1 brilliantly! Now beginning Week 2: Data Visualization.

Context Reminder:
- Location: /Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/frontend/wealth-manager/
- Stack: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, React Query, Supabase
- Completed: Full dashboard with calculated balances from 12-table schema

üéØ Day 5 Specific Tasks:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Recharts
2Ô∏è‚É£ Create useHistoricalData Hook
3Ô∏è‚É£ Build PortfolioAllocationChart
4Ô∏è‚É£ Build NetWorthTrendChart
5Ô∏è‚É£ Build AccountBalanceChart
6Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate Charts into Dashboard

Perfect! Starting Week 2: Data Visualization with Day 5. Let me begin with installing Recharts and building the chart components systematically.

[Implementation proceeded through all 6 tasks successfully]

## üö® Critical Issues Discovered & Resolved

### Database Permission Problem
**Root Cause:** The Supabase `anon` role had zero permissions on database tables, causing all API calls to return "permission denied" even though the database contained real data.

**Data Available:**
- **Kernan Family** (individual) - ID: `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`
- **Milton Preschool Inc** (s_corp) - ID: `22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222`
- **3 accounts total:** Joint Brokerage, Cash Management Account, Brokerage Account

**Solution Applied:**
```sql
-- Grant read permissions for local development
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO anon;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO anon;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO anon;
```

**Verification:** API endpoints now return real data:
```json
[{"id":"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111","entity_name":"Kernan Family","entity_type":"individual"},
 {"id":"22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222","entity_name":"Milton Preschool Inc","entity_type":"s_corp"}]
```

### Frontend Architecture

**Key Components Implemented:**
1. **useHistoricalData.ts** - React Query hook with 3 specialized data queries
2. **NetWorthTrendChart.tsx** - 30-day line chart with entity breakdown
3. **PortfolioAllocationChart.tsx** - Pie chart by security type
4. **AccountBalanceChart.tsx** - Horizontal bars with tax treatment color coding
5. **ChartErrorBoundary.tsx** - Reusable error handling

**Balance Calculation Engine:**
- Hybrid approach: Investment accounts use `positions` table, bank accounts use `transactions`
- Smart detection based on `account_type` field
- Located in `/lib/calculations/balanceCalculations.ts`

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Added "Portfolio Analytics" section to main dashboard
- Full-width NetWorthTrendChart + responsive 2-column layout for other charts
- Real-time data with React Query 5-minute caching

## Current Working State

**Development Server:** Should run clean with `npm run dev` from `/Users/richkernan/Projects/Finances/frontend/wealth-manager/`

**What Should Work at http://localhost:3000:**
- **NetWorthCard:** Real calculated totals from financial data
- **Three Charts:** All populated with actual data
  - Net Worth Trend: 30-day performance with multi-entity lines
  - Portfolio Allocation: Asset distribution by security type
  - Account Balances: Top accounts with tax treatment colors
- **Entity Grid:** 2 clickable cards for Kernan Family and Milton Preschool Inc
- **AccountsList:** Real account data with institutions

**Entity Detail Pages (Clickable from cards):**
- `/entities/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111` (Kernan Family)
- `/entities/22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222` (Milton Preschool Inc)

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Chart Color Palette:**
```javascript
const CHART_COLORS = {
  primary: '#00945F',    // Fidelity green
  secondary: '#00A86B',  // Lighter green
  tertiary: '#7FB069',   // Even lighter
  negative: '#DC143C',   // Red for losses
  neutral: '#6B7280',    // Gray
}
```

**Data Flow:**
1. `useHistoricalData` hook queries positions table with `position_date` grouping
2. `calculateAccountBalance` uses hybrid logic (positions vs transactions)
3. Components handle loading states, errors, and empty data gracefully
4. Charts use ResponsiveContainer for mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints

**File Structure:**
```

## Testing & Debugging Context

### Current Known Issues & Solutions

**‚ö†Ô∏è 404 Errors Expected:**
- `/accounts`, `/entities` (list pages) - These routes were never built, only detail pages exist
- Only working routes: `/` (dashboard) and `/entities/[entityId]` (individual entity pages)

**üö® Database Connection Troubleshooting:**

If you see "No live data" or empty charts, follow this diagnostic sequence:

**Step 1: Verify Database is Running**
```bash
# Check if Supabase is running
supabase status
# Should show services running on ports 54321 (API) and 54322 (DB)
```

**Step 2: Test Direct Database Connection**
```bash
# Test PostgreSQL directly
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entities;"
# Should return: count = 2
```

**Step 3: Test Supabase API Endpoints**
```bash
# Test entities endpoint with anon key
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:54321/rest/v1/entities?select=id,entity_name,entity_type&limit=5" \
  -H "apikey: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJleHAiOjE5ODM4MTI5OTZ9.CRXP1A7WOeoJeXxjNni43kdQwgnWNReilDMblYTn_I0"

# Expected success response:
# [{"id":"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111","entity_name":"Kernan Family","entity_type":"individual"},
#  {"id":"22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222","entity_name":"Milton Preschool Inc","entity_type":"s_corp"}]

# If you get "permission denied", re-run permissions fix:
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres -c "
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO anon;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO anon;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO anon;
"
```

**Step 4: Check Environment Variables**
```bash
# Verify .env.local contains:
cat .env.local
# Should show:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Step 5: Browser Network Tab Debugging**
- Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
- Refresh dashboard
- Look for calls to `127.0.0.1:54321/rest/v1/entities`
- Check if they return 200 (success) or 403 (permission denied)

**Common Solutions:**
1. **Supabase not running:** `cd` to main project directory and run `supabase start`
2. **Wrong port:** Ensure frontend connects to 54321 (API), not 54322 (direct DB)
3. **Permissions reset:** Database restarts can reset permissions - re-run GRANT commands
4. **Environment mismatch:** Verify `.env.local` uses 127.0.0.1, not localhost

**Expected Behavior When Working:**
- Charts render within ~500ms after data loading
- Dashboard shows "Kernan Family" and "Milton Preschool Inc" entity cards
- NetWorthCard displays calculated totals (not $0.00)
- Browser console shows successful API calls to Supabase

**Query Performance:**
- React Query caches with 5-minute staleTime
- Historical data limited to last 30 position dates
- Balance calculations optimized with Promise.all

## Handoff Note

The conversation above removed ~11k tokens of git operations and error debugging cycles. You're picking up with a fully functional financial dashboard displaying real data from a 12-table Supabase schema.

**Key context for continuity:**
- Technical approach: Production-ready patterns with proper TypeScript, error boundaries, responsive design
- User communication: Values quality, direct feedback, systematic progression through implementation phases
- Development pattern: Quality checks at each step, git commits at major milestones, real data integration prioritized
- Current state: Week 1 + Day 5 complete, ready for advanced features (Week 2 continuation: tables, export, interactivity)

The dashboard should be fully functional for testing and evaluation. Please respond as if you built this system and are ready to help debug, enhance, or extend its functionality.
