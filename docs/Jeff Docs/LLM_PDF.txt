                                                     1

         The existing Lease between Seller and Purchaser's Affiliate shall terminate automatically

                (a)    Within three (3) business days after the Effective Date, Purchaser shall
deposit into an escrow trust (the “Escrow”) established with Calloway Title and Escrow, LLC, Attn:

prorations and adjustments as set forth in Section 17 hereof, shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller
by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds on the Closing Date (as defined below).

       6.      Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

               (a)  Seller’s Representations and Warranties. As a material inducement to
Purchaser to execute this Agreement and consummate this transaction, Seller represents and
warrants to Purchaser as of the date hereof and continuing through and including the Closing
Date as follows:

                        (1)    Organization and Authority. Seller has been duly organized and is
       validly existing as a Georgia limited liability company. Seller has the full right and authority
       to enter into this Agreement, consummate or cause to be consummated the sale and make
       or cause to be made transfers and assignments contemplated herein and has obtained
       with respect to entering into this Agreement or shall by Closing obtained all consents (if
       any) required to approve the closing on the transaction contemplated herein. The persons
       signing this Agreement on behalf of Seller are authorized to do so. This Agreement and
       all of the documents to be delivered by Seller at the Closing have been (or will be)
       authorized and properly executed and will constitute the valid and binding obligations of
       Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with their terms.

                        (2)     Conflicts. To Seller’s Knowledge, there is no agreement to which
       Seller is a party or binding on Seller or the Property, which is in conflict with this Agreement
       or which would limit or restrict the timely performance by Seller of its obligations pursuant
       to this Agreement.

                       (3)     Documents and Records. Within five (5) business days of the
       Effective Date, Seller will provide to Purchaser, to the extent in Seller’s possession and
       control, copies of all certificates of occupancy and zoning reports for the Property, copies
       of all environmental, engineering, and physical condition reports for the Property, and
       copies of all warranties relating to the improvements constructed on the Property, if any
       (all of the foregoing collectively the “Property Information”). To Seller’s Knowledge, all
       copies of the Property Information to be provided to Purchaser are true, correct and
       complete.

                     (4)     Litigation. There is no action, suit or proceeding pending or, to
       Seller’s Knowledge, threatened against either Seller or the Property which: (i) if adversely
       determined, would materially affect the Property, or (ii) challenges or impairs Seller’s ability
       to execute, deliver or perform this Agreement or consummate the transaction
       contemplated hereby.

                       (5)    Leases. The only Lease of the Premises is the one between Seller
       and Purchaser’s Affiliate (the “Lease”). Other than that Lease, any other matters disclosed
       in the Title Commitment (as defined below) and Surviving Service Contracts, there are no
       leases, licenses, occupancy or use, or other rental agreements to which Seller is a party
       or is bound affecting any portion of the Premises as of the Effective Date, which will be in
       force on the Closing Date. Seller has not entered into any written agreement with any


                                                  3

government assistance with rent payments. No commission, fee or other compensation is
payable (or will, with the passage of time or occurrence of any event or both, be payable),
with respect to any Lease, and there are no leasing commissions, fees or other
compensation payable in respect of any renewals, modifications or amendments of the
Lease. There does not currently exist any exclusive or continuing leasing or brokerage
agreements as to any of the space covered by the Lease or as to any space in the
Premises.

               (6)      Service Contracts. Exhibit B sets forth all of the Service Contracts
presently outstanding with respect to the Property. To Seller’s Knowledge, neither Seller
nor any other party is in default with respect to any of its obligations or liabilities pertaining
to the Service Contracts. Seller has not received any advance payments or other income
from the service provider under any Service Contract in exchange for agreeing to enter
into such Service Contract (regardless of whether such advance payment or other income
was paid in a lump sum or in installments). Each of the Service Contracts is terminable
upon not more than thirty (30) days’ prior written notice without payment of any fee or
penalty.

                (7)     Notice of Violations. Seller has received no written notice that either
the Property or the use thereof violates any laws, rules and regulations of any federal,
state, city or county government or any agency, body, or subdivision thereof having any
jurisdiction over the Property that have not been resolved to the satisfaction of the issuer
of the notice.

             (8)     Withholding Obligation. Seller is not a “foreign person” within the
meaning of Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

threatened condemnation or similar proceedings affecting the Property or any part thereof
other than a proposed eminent domain action by the Georgia Department of
Transportation which, if pursued, would not adversely affect the continued use of the
Premises for the existing purposes.

              (10) Insurance Notices. Seller has not received any uncured notices

Property.

or the presence or release of Hazardous Materials (as defined below) on or from the
Property. Seller has not manufactured, introduced, released or discharged from, on, under
or adjacent to the Property any Hazardous Materials or any toxic wastes, substances or
materials (including, without limitation, asbestos), and Seller has not used the Property or
any part thereof for the generation, treatment, storage, handling or disposal of any

              (b)      Purchaser’s Representations and Warranties. As a material inducement to
Seller to execute this Agreement and consummate this transaction, Purchaser represents and
warrants to Seller as of the date hereof and continuing through to the Closing Date as follows:

               (i)    Purchaser has been duly organized and is validly existing as a limited
liability company organized pursuant to the laws of the State of Georgia. Purchaser has the full
right and authority and has obtained any and all consents required therefor to enter into this
Agreement, consummate or cause to be consummated the purchase, and make or cause to be
made the deliveries and undertakings contemplated herein or hereby. The persons signing this
Agreement on behalf of Purchaser are authorized to do so. This Agreement and all of the
documents to be delivered by Purchaser at the Closing have been (or will be) authorized and

ruling of any court or governmental authority applicable to Purchaser.

              (iii)   There are no actions, suits, or proceedings pending or, to Purchaser’s

Property.

               (c)     Representations and Warranties Prior to Closing.

                       The continued validity in all respects of the foregoing representations and
warranties shall be a condition precedent to the obligation of the party to whom the representation
and warranty is given to close the transaction contemplated herein.

                        (1)    If (i) any of Seller’s representations and warranties shall not be true
and correct in any material respect at any time on or before the Closing whether or not true and
correct as of the Effective Date, or (ii) any change in facts or circumstances has made the
applicable representation and warranty no longer true and correct in any material respect and
regardless as to whether Purchaser becomes aware of such fact through Seller’s notification or
otherwise, then if not cured by Seller within thirty (30) days of Purchaser delivering written notice
of such breach or default to Seller, the Purchaser may, at Purchaser’s option, exercised by written
notice to Seller (and as its sole and exclusive remedy), either: (y) proceed with this transaction,
accepting the applicable representation and warranty as being modified by such subsequent
matters or knowledge and waiving any right relating thereto, if any, or (z) terminate this Agreement


                                                  7
and declare this Agreement of no further force and effect, in which event the Earnest Money shall
be immediately returned to Purchaser and Seller shall have no further liability or obligation
hereunder by reason thereof, including, without limitation, the obligation to incur any additional
costs or expenses contemplated under this Agreement, and any other provision of this Agreement
that is expressly intended to survive the termination of this Agreement, and, if the breach of any
representation and warranty of Seller hereunder results from the willful and intentional act of
Seller, Purchaser shall also have the rights and remedies available to Purchaser under
Section 18(b) of this Agreement upon a default by Seller of its obligations under this Agreement.

                (2)     If (i) any of Purchaser’s representations and warranties shall not be true
and correct in any material respect at any time on or before the Closing whether or not true and
correct as of the Effective Date, or (ii) any change in facts or circumstances has made the
applicable representation and warranty no longer true and correct in any material respect and
regardless as to whether Seller becomes aware of such fact through Purchaser’s notification or
otherwise, then if not cured by Purchaser within thirty (30) days of Seller delivering written notice
of such breach or default to Purchaser, the Seller may, at Seller’s option, exercised by written
notice to Purchaser (and as its sole and exclusive remedy), either: (y) proceed with this
transaction, accepting the applicable representation and warranty as being modified by such
subsequent matters or knowledge and waiving any right relating thereto, if any, or (z) terminate
this Agreement and declare this Agreement of no further force and effect, in which event the
Earnest Money shall be immediately paid to Seller and Purchaser shall have no further liability or
obligation hereunder by reason thereof, including, without limitation, the obligation to incur any
additional costs or expenses contemplated under this Agreement, and any other provision of this
Agreement that is expressly intended to survive the termination of this Agreement, and, if the
breach of any representation and warranty of Purchaser hereunder results from the willful and
intentional act of Purchaser, Seller shall also have the rights and remedies available to Seller
under Section 18(a) of this Agreement upon a default by Purchaser of its obligations under this
Agreement.

                (d)     Limitation on Liability; Survival. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except as specifically provided in Section 6 and its subparts, NO
CLAIM FOR A BREACH BY SELLER OF AN OBLIGATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT THAT
SURVIVES CLOSING SHALL BE ACTIONABLE OR PAYABLE IF THE BREACH IN QUESTION
WAS KNOWN TO PURCHASER PRIOR TO CLOSING (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
IN THE CASE OF A KNOWN MATTER). If the breach occurs or becomes known to Purchaser
after Closing, a claim for a breach of any surviving representation, warranty, and/or obligation of
Seller shall be actionable only if the valid claims for all such breaches collectively aggregate more
than $10,000.00, in which event the full amount of such claim shall be actionable up to the Cap
(as defined below), and provided written notice containing a description of the specific nature of
such breach shall have been given by Purchaser to Seller prior to the date that is no later than
the applicable statute of limitation following the Closing and an action shall have been
commenced by Purchaser against Seller and served by Purchaser upon Seller prior to the
expiration or termination of such survival period; again, the parties hereby acknowledging and
otherwise confirming that it is their intent as well as Purchaser's agreement to limit the period of
time within which Purchaser may bring an action, so that claims, if they may be brought at all,
must be filed and served and otherwise made in accordance within the time periods specified
herein. As used herein, the term “Cap” shall mean the total aggregate amount which equals the
Purchase Price herein In no event shall Seller’s aggregate liability to Purchaser for breach of any
obligation of Seller in this Agreement, in any certificate, instrument or other document delivered
by Seller in connection with this Agreement, the Closing, or otherwise, exceed the amount of the
Cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Cap shall not apply to or limit Seller’s liability


                                                 8

                      (1)      Seller will timely pay and perform its obligations under the Leases.
       Prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Seller agrees that it will not enter into
       any new Leases, amend, or terminate any Leases prior to the Closing Date without the
       prior written consent of Purchaser in each instance, which consent shall not be
       unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by Purchaser. After the expiration of the
       Due Diligence Period, Seller agrees that it will not enter into any new Leases, amend, or
       terminate any Leases prior to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
       Purchaser in each instance, which shall be subject to Purchaser’s sole discretion.

                         (2)    Seller will timely pay and perform its obligations under the Service
       Contracts. Seller agrees to effectively terminate (and give written notices of such
       termination to all of the other parties thereto), effective as of Closing, any of the Service
       Contracts that Purchaser, pursuant to written notice to Seller after the expiration of the
       Due Diligence Period, requests that Seller terminate and Seller shall pay any and all
       monetary penalties/fees and or settlements related to the early termination of any Service
       Contracts. If any service provider asserts any claims or files a lawsuit against the Property
       or Seller or Purchaser in connection with or related to such termination, Seller shall be
       solely responsible for all costs and fees related to defending such claims or lawsuits and
       shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser harmless from any loss, cost, expenses and
       liability related thereto. Seller agrees that it will not enter into any new Service Contracts
       or amend or terminate any Service Contracts prior to the Closing Date without the prior
       written consent of Purchaser in each instance.

                      (3)     Seller will not enter into any contract or agreement that will be an
       obligation affecting the Property subsequent to the Closing Date except for contracts
       entered into in the ordinary course of business that are terminable without cause and
       without payment of a fee or penalty on not more than thirty (30) days’ notice.

                       (4)     Seller will not remove or cause or permit the removal of any
       Personal Property from the Premises except as may be necessary for repair or
       replacement, and in the event of such replacement, the replacement shall be of a quality
       that is equal to or better than the Property being removed when new.

                      (5)     Seller will continue to operate and maintain the Property in
       accordance with past practices and in accordance with applicable law and will not make
       any material alterations or changes thereto.

                     (6)     Seller will maintain casualty and liability insurance of a level and
       type consistent with the insurance maintained by Seller prior to the execution of this
       Agreement with respect to the Property.

                    (7)     Seller shall not do anything, nor authorize anything to be done,
       which would adversely affect the condition of title as shown on the Title Commitment.




                                                 9
                      (8)    Seller agrees to effectively terminate (and give written notices of
       such termination to all of the other parties thereto), effective as of Closing, any of the
       Service Contracts that Purchaser, pursuant to written notice to Seller after the Due
       Diligence Period, requests Seller to terminate at Seller’s cost and expense.

                       (9)     Seller shall give immediate notice to Purchaser in the event Seller
       receives notice or obtains knowledge of: (i) the taking or threatened taking of the Property
       or any portion thereof by eminent domain or other applicable legal proceeding; (ii) any
       casualty relating to the Property; (iii) the filing or threat to file an action, claim or proceeding
       in any court or administrative agency against Seller which may affect the Property; or (iv)
       any violation of any legal requirements, or insurance requirements, affecting the Property,
       any service of process relating to the Property or which affects Seller’s ability to perform
       its obligations under this Agreement or any other correspondence or notice received by
       Seller which has or has the potential to have an adverse effect on the Property.

       7.      Due Diligence Period.

               (a)      Purchaser shall have a period beginning on the Effective Date and ending
at 11:59 p.m., local time where the Property is located, on the date which is thirty (30) calendar            Deleted: sixty
days from the Effective Date (the “Due Diligence Period”), to examine, inspect, and investigate               Deleted: 6
the Property and, in Purchaser’s sole discretion, to determine whether Purchaser wishes to
proceed to purchase the Property.

                (b)     Purchaser may terminate this Agreement for any reason or for no reason
by giving written notice of such termination to Seller on or before the last day of the Due Diligence
Period. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 7, the Earnest Money shall be
immediately returned to Purchaser, and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation
to the other under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligation to incur any
additional costs or expenses contemplated under this Agreement, except for the indemnity
provisions set forth in Section 22(p) of this Agreement and any other provision of this Agreement
that is expressly intended to survive the termination of this Agreement.

               (c)    Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event that
by reason of one or more “Weather Delay Events” (as defined below), Purchaser is not able to
perform Purchaser’s obligations for Closing, then upon Purchaser’s written notice to Seller given
on or prior to the expiration of the Closing, as applicable, the Closing, as applicable, shall be
extended for a period of time reasonably determined by Purchaser and Seller not to exceed sixty
(60) days. For purpose herein, a “Weather Delay Event” means, as determined in good faith by
the party claiming the occurrence of such event or occurrence, any hurricane, tropical storm or
other weather event occurring on or about the Closing Date which directly results in an event
which causes actual delay for Purchaser at Closing.

               (d)     Subject to the rights of tenants under the Leases, Purchaser, accompanied
by a designated representative of Seller, during the Due Diligence Period and through the Closing,
shall have reasonable access to the Property and the tenants of the Property for the purpose of
conducting interviews, surveys, architectural, engineering, environmental inspections and tests,
and any other inspections, studies, or tests reasonably required by Purchaser. Purchaser shall
give Seller not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior telephonic notice before entering onto the
Property to perform inspections or tests, and in the case of tests (i) Purchaser shall specify to
Seller the precise nature of the test to be performed, and (ii) Seller may require, as a condition
precedent to Purchaser’s right to perform any such test, that Purchaser deliver Seller evidence of


                                                   10
public liability and other appropriate insurance naming Seller as an additional insured thereunder.
Such examination of the physical condition of the Property may include an examination and/or
audit for the presence or absence of hazardous or toxic materials, substances or wastes
(collectively, “Hazardous Materials”), which shall be performed or arranged by Purchaser at
Purchaser’s sole expense. Purchaser shall keep the Property free and clear of any liens and will
indemnify, protect, defend, and hold each of Seller and its officers, directors members, managers,
employees, and agents (each, a “Seller Related Party”) harmless from and against all losses,
costs, damages, claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court
costs) arising from physical damage to the Property and injury to persons asserted against or
incurred by any Seller Related Party as a result of such entry by Purchaser, its agents, employees
or representatives (provided that Purchaser shall not be responsible for the discovery of any pre-
existing conditions on the Property). If any inspection or test damages the Property and
Purchaser does not acquire the Property, Purchaser will restore the Property to substantially the
same condition as existed prior to any such inspection or test. The completion of any required
restoration or repair of damage that is the responsibility of Purchaser pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be performed in accordance with all applicable codes and ordinances in a good
and workmanlike manner shall be a condition precedent to the release of the Earnest Money in
the amount reasonably related to the work be performed, with Seller and Purchaser each acting
in good faith with respect to making any such determination, in the event Purchaser should
terminate the Agreement during the Due Diligence Period. Purchaser and its agents, employees
and representatives may, upon not less than twenty-four (24) hours prior telephonic or email
notice to Seller (with it being agreed that no other form of notice is required), examine and make
copies of all books and records and other materials relating to the condition of the Property in
Seller’s possession at the location where such records are maintained. Any information provided
to or obtained by Purchaser with respect to the Property shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 22(o) of this Agreement.

       8.      As Is Sale.

     EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER
SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS (AS DEFINED
BELOW), PURCHASER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT SELLER IS NOT MAKING AND
HAS NOT AT ANY TIME MADE ANY WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND
OR CHARACTER, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY OR THE
TRUTH, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY MATERIALS, DATA OR INFORMATION

       9.      Survival of Representations After Closing.

                (a)    All representations and warranties of Seller herein shall survive the Closing
for the period which runs the same length of the appropriate and applicable statues of limitations
set forth by Georgia law (the “Seller’s Limitation Period”). All representations of warranties of
Purchaser shall survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement by Purchaser for the time
period which runs the same length as the appropriate and applicable statues of limitations set
forth by Georgia law (the “Purchaser’s Limitation Period”).

               (b)      Purchaser shall provide written notice to Seller of any breach of any of
Seller’s warranties or representations of which Purchaser acquires knowledge, through any
means, at any time after the Closing Date but prior to the expiration of the Seller’s Limitation
Period, and shall allow Seller thirty (30) days from the date of such Purchaser’s notice to Seller
within which to cure such breach, or, if such breach is susceptible of cure but cannot reasonably
be cured within thirty (30) days, an additional reasonable time period required to effect such cure
so long as such cure has been commenced within such thirty (30) days and diligently pursued but
in no event more than ninety (90) days from the date of such Purchaser’s notice to Seller. The
Closing Date shall be extended until such breach has been cured, in the event Purchaser elects
to continue the Agreement to allow Seller to cure same. If Seller fails to cure such breach after
written notice and within such cure period (as extended), Purchaser’s sole remedy shall be an
action at law for damages as a consequence thereof, and Purchaser shall have all equitable
remedies, all of which may be exercised by Purchaser within Seller’s Limitation Period.

               (c)    Seller shall provide written notice to Purchaser of any breach of any of
Purchaser’s warranties or representations of which Seller acquires knowledge, through any
means, at any time after the Closing Date but prior to the expiration of the Purchaser’s Limitation
Period, and shall allow Purchaser thirty (30) days from the date of such Seller’s notice to
Purchaser within which to cure such breach, or, if such breach is susceptible of cure but cannot
reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days, an additional reasonable time period required to effect
such cure so long as such cure has been commenced within such thirty (30) days and diligently
pursued but in no event more than ninety (90) days from the date of such Seller’s notice to
Purchaser. If Purchaser fails to cure such breach after written notice and within such cure period
(as extended), Seller’s sole remedy shall be an action at law for damages as a consequence
thereof, and Seller shall have all equitable remedies, all of which may be exercised by Seller
within Purchaser’s Limitation Period.

       10.     Closing.

               (a)      The Closing shall be accomplished through the escrow referred to in
Section 10(b) below, and shall take place on the date (the “Closing Date”) that is selected by
Purchaser by written notice to Seller, which date shall be no later than January 6th, 2025. seventy
five (75) days after the date upon which the Due Diligence Period expires, provided that all
conditions precedent to the Closing have been fulfilled or have been waived in writing by the
respective party entitled to waive same.                                                               Commented [A1]: This is the “outside date” from Charles’

                (b)     On or prior to the date set for Closing under this Agreement, the parties
shall establish a money escrow with Escrow Agent. Counsel for the respective parties are hereby
authorized to execute the escrow trust instructions as well as any amendments thereto on behalf
of their respective clients.

as the Agreement has not been terminated, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
diligent efforts to proceed with obtaining the approval, with Purchaser cooperating with

        Agreement;

                       (2)     Purchaser shall be prepared to deliver to Seller all instruments and

        to any other provision hereof for reasons other than Seller’s breach or default, Purchaser’s
        termination during due diligence (including without limitation due to title and survey
        objection), or by the mutual agreement of the parties; and

                        (4)     Purchaser shall not be in material breach or default of this
        Agreement.

                  (b)     In the event that any of the foregoing conditions shall not have been fulfilled
on or before the time for Closing hereunder, then subject to the provisions of Section 18(a) hereof,
Seller may elect, upon notice to Purchaser, to terminate this Agreement, in which event the

liability or obligation to the other, including, without limitation, the obligation to incur any additional
costs or expenses contemplated under this Agreement, and any other provision of this Agreement
that is expressly intended to survive the termination of this Agreement.

        13.     Title Insurance.

             (a)     Within fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date, Seller, at Seller’s sole cost
and expense, shall cause to have issued by Escrow Agent and underwritten by a national title
insurance company (hereinafter “Title Insurer”) to deliver to Purchaser a commitment for the Title



                                                    14
Policy described in Section 13(b) (the “Title Commitment”), together with legible copies of all of
the underlying documentation described in such Title Commitment (the “Title Documents”) to the
extent not already delivered to Purchaser. Within fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date, Seller,
shall cause to be delivered to Purchaser the most current survey of the Property in Seller’s
possession or control, prepared by a surveyor licensed in the state in which the Property is located
(the “Survey”). Purchaser may order an update to the Survey, or obtain its own survey, and Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with such updates (the “Updated Survey”). The Due Diligence Period
shall be extended for each day in which Seller does not deliver the Title Commitment or Survey
as required under this Section 13(a).

                 (b)      Purchaser shall have a period of time up to the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period (“Title Review Period”) in which to review the Title Commitment, the Title
Documents, the Updated Survey, if any, and the Survey and notify Seller in writing, at Purchaser’s
election, of such objections as Purchaser may have to any matters contained therein
(“Purchaser’s Objection Notice”); any of said objections listed on Purchaser’s Objection Notice
are deemed the “Objectionable Exceptions”); provided that, Purchaser agrees to act in good
faith in delivering its Purchaser’s Objection Notice to Seller and the contents and requests therein.
If Seller does not notify Purchaser in writing within ten (10) calendar days after receiving
Purchaser’s Objection Notice, Seller shall conclusively be deemed to have agreed to remove all
said Objectionable Exceptions at or before Closing. On the other hand, if Seller notifies Purchaser
in writing within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of Purchaser’s Objection Notice that it has
elected not to cure one or more of said Objectionable Exceptions (“Seller’s Notice”)(subject to
Seller’s obligation to remove or cure those items referenced in Section 13(e) and 13(f)(4) below),
Purchaser shall have the right to either (a) terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice
within five (5) business days after receipt of such Seller’s Notice, in which event, the Earnest
Money shall be returned to Purchaser and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations
under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligation to incur any additional costs or
expenses contemplated under this Agreement, and any other provision of this Agreement that is
expressly intended to survive the termination of this Agreement, or (b) Purchaser may
consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof, in which event, all those Objectionable Exceptions that Seller has so elected not to cure
shall conclusively be deemed to constitute “Permitted Encumbrances”. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to Closing, Seller shall cause to have the Title Insurer, at its cost and expense,
obtain an update to the Title Commitment which updates the effective date of the Title
Commitment. If such update or endorsement adds any previously unlisted title or survey
exceptions to Schedule B-II of the Title Commitment or its equivalent which, one or more of the
following: (i) renders title to the Premises unmarketable, or (ii) would materially and adversely
affect Purchaser’s contemplated use(s) of the Premises as an office building, Purchaser may
object to any such new exception(s) by delivering written notice to Seller prior to Closing and: (x)
any such notice shall be treated as a Purchaser’s Objection Notice, (y) the exception(s) objected
to in any such notice shall be treated as Objectionable Exceptions, and (z) Seller shall have until
the earlier to occur of: (1) the time period provided under Section 13(b), or (2) the Closing, to
respond to such Purchaser’s Objection Notice; provided, however, that matters of title or survey
created by, through, or under Purchaser, if any, shall not be objectionable and shall automatically
be deemed additional Permitted Encumbrances. The previous sentence shall in no manner allow
Purchaser the authority to create any matters concerning title or survey and Seller’s ownership of
the Property prior to Closing, and any creation by Purchaser of matters concerning title or survey
prior to Closing without the express written authorization of Seller shall otherwise be deemed a
default of this Agreement by Purchaser.




                                                 15
                (c)     Seller, at its sole expense, shall cause to be delivered to Purchaser at
Closing an owner’s title insurance policy (the “Title Policy”) issued by Title Insurer, dated the day
of Closing, in the full amount of the Purchase Price, the form of which shall be American Land
Title Association Owner’s Policy, Standard Form B, 2006 (or such other form required or
promulgated pursuant to applicable state insurance regulations), subject only to the Permitted
Exceptions (as defined below). The Title Policy may contain any endorsements requested by
Purchaser; provided that, Purchaser shall satisfy itself as to the availability of any such
endorsements prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period. The costs of any such
endorsements shall be paid for by Purchaser unless otherwise provided herein.

                (d)       Prior to the expiration of the Title Review Period, Purchaser shall review
title to the Premises as disclosed by the Title Commitment, the Survey and the Updated Survey,
and satisfy itself as to the availability from Title Insurer of all requested endorsements to such Title
Policy.

               (e)     Seller shall have no obligation to remove or cure title objections, except for

basis of the number of days in the month or for yearly paid amounts on the basis of the number
of days in the year of Closing. The parties agree that the Closing Date shall be an income and
expense day for Purchaser. To the extent any prorations or adjustments cannot be made at the
Closing, or to the extent there are to be reprorations, the same shall be adjusted and completed



                                                18
after the Closing as and when complete information becomes available (subject to the re-proration
provision set forth in Section 17(a) with respect to taxes). The terms and provisions of this
Section 17 shall survive the Closing.

                (a)     Real Estate and Personal Property Taxes and Assessments. Real estate
and personal property taxes and assessments will be prorated between Purchaser and Seller for
the period for which such taxes are assessed, regardless of when payable. If the current tax bill
is available at Closing, then the proration shall be made on the basis of one hundred ten percent
(110%) of the November discounted amount of the most recent ascertainable tax assessment and
tax rate or the actual amount if the November discounted amount is no longer available as of the
date of Closing. If the current tax bill is not available at Closing, then the proration shall be made
on the basis of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the November discounted amount of the most
recent ascertainable tax assessment and tax rate. In such instance, after Closing, either party
may seek a re-proration within ninety (90) days of the availability of actual bills for the current tax
period and such additional amounts as may be owing to either party shall be paid by the owing
party within ten (10) days from its receipt of an invoice for such amount from the party that is
owed. Any taxes paid at or prior to Closing shall be prorated based upon the amounts actually
paid. If taxes and assessments for the fiscal year in which Closing occurs or any prior years have
not been paid before Closing, Purchaser shall be credited by Seller at the time of Closing with an
amount equal to that portion of such taxes and assessments which are ratably attributable to the
period before the Closing Date and such payment shall become the sole responsibility of the
Purchaser (subject to the reproration provision of this Section 17(a)), and Purchaser shall pay
(or cause to be paid) the taxes and assessments prior to their becoming delinquent. If taxes and
assessments for the fiscal year in which Closing occurs have been established and paid before
Closing (or are paid at Closing with proceeds from the Purchase Price), Seller shall be credited
by Purchaser at the time of Closing with an amount equal to that portion of such taxes and
assessments which are ratably attributable to the period from and after the Closing Date. To the
extent that the Property is not a separate real estate parcel for tax purposes at the time of Closing,
the Seller and Purchaser shall agree in good faith on an equitable allocation of tax liability for tax
purposes (and each party shall pay its share of such amounts on or prior to the applicable due
date). Special assessments which are confirmed or become a lien prior to Closing shall be paid
by Seller at Closing.

                (b)    Utilities. All utilities shall be prorated based upon estimates using the most
recent actual invoices. Seller shall receive a credit for the amount of deposits, if any, with utility
companies that are transferable and that are assigned to Purchaser at the Closing. In the case of
non-transferable deposits, Purchaser shall be responsible for making any security deposits
required by utility companies providing service to the Premises. All utilities shall be transferred
into the name of the Purchaser effective as of the day of Closing, and all expenses for all utilities
for the day of Closing shall be paid for by the Purchaser, consistent with the requirements of this
Section 17.

                (c)    Collected Rent. Purchaser shall receive a credit for any rent and other
income (and any applicable state or local tax on rent) under Leases collected by Seller before
Closing that applies to any period after Closing. Uncollected rent and other uncollected income
shall not be prorated at Closing. After Closing, Purchaser shall apply all rent and income collected
by Purchaser from a tenant (x) first to such tenant’s rental obligations for the month in which the
payment is made, (y) next to such tenant’s monthly rental for the month in which the Closing
occurs, and (z) then to arrearages in the reverse order in which they were due, remitting to Seller,
after deducting reasonable collection costs, any rent or expense reimbursements properly
allocable to Seller’s period of ownership. Purchaser shall bill and attempt to collect such rent


                                                  19
arrearages in the ordinary course of business, but shall not be obligated to engage a collection
agency or take legal action to collect any rent arrearages. Any rent or other income received by
Seller or Purchaser after Closing which are owed to Seller or Purchaser shall be remitted to Seller
or Purchaser as applicable, promptly after receipt. In addition, Purchaser shall receive a credit at
Closing for any unpaid lease concessions, allowances, free rent, or other similar items under the
Leases.

               (d)    Security Deposits. To the extent same exist, all unapplied security, or other
deposits (and interest thereon if required by law or contract to be earned thereon) under the
Leases, shall be credited to Purchaser at Closing. Seller represents to Purchaser it is holding a
security deposit under the Lease in the amount of $1,200,000 plus accrued interest.                         Commented [A2]: For clarity, I don't actually hold the security
                                                                                                            deposit. It's held by Truist in Jeff’s name I think. I assume I would

receive a credit for prepaid charges and premiums applicable to Purchaser’s period of ownership.
Purchaser shall receive a credit for any payments made in arrears. Any non-refundable deposits
together with any up-front payments under cable, phone or other Service Contracts shall be
retained by Seller for any terminated Service Contracts and such deposits shall be credited to
Seller at Closing for any surviving Service Contracts.

                 (f)     Owner Deposits. Seller shall be entitled to the return of all bonds, deposits,
letters of credit, set aside letters or other similar items, if any, that are outstanding with respect to
the Property that have been provided by Seller or any of its affiliates, agents or investment
advisors to any governmental agency, public utility, or similar entity (collectively, “Owner
Deposits”). Purchaser shall replace such Owner Deposits with respect to the Property. To the
extent that any funds are released as a result of the termination of any Owner Deposits for which
Seller did not receive a credit, such funds shall be delivered to Seller promptly upon their receipt.

               (g)    Leasing Commissions and Tenant Improvement Allowances. To the extent
same exist, Seller shall be responsible for all leasing commissions, other leasing costs and any
tenant improvement allowances (collectively, “TI & Leasing Commissions”) due and payable
with respect to all Leases executed prior to the Closing Date. If any such TI & Leasing
Commissions are not fully paid by Closing, with Seller providing reasonable written evidence of
all such amounts that have been paid pursuant to the Leases, Purchaser shall receive a credit for
                                                                                                            Deleted: Seller,
all such unpaid TI & Leasing Commissions from Seller at Closing. It is understood and agreed
that the Purchaser shall be solely responsible from and after Closing for any TI & Leasing                  Deleted: as landlord under the Leases, may currently be
                                                                                                            collecting from Tenants under the Leases additional rent to
Commissions that relate to Leases executed after the Closing Date but in accordance with this               cover taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other
Agreement.                                                                                                  operating costs and expenses (collectively, “Operating
                                                                                                            Expense Pass-Throughs”) incurred by Seller in connection
                                                                                                            with the ownership, operation, maintenance and management
                (h)     Operating Expense Pass-Throughs. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge                   of the Property. If Seller has collected estimated payments of
that Purchaser, as current tenant has paid all operating expenses directly to third parties for the         Operating Expense Pass-Throughs in excess of or in an
                                                                                                            amount less than any Tenant’s share of such expenses with
past [2+] years. No operating expense reconciliation is required, and neither party shall have any          respect to the period during which Seller owned the Property,
obligation to the other regarding operating expense pass-throughs.                                          then the parties shall make an adjusting payment between
                                                                                                            them when the correct amounts can be determined, but in any

                (a)       Purchaser’s Default. If this transaction fails to close due to the default of
Purchaser, then Seller’s sole remedy in (i.e., with respect to) such event shall be to terminate this
Agreement and to receive from Purchaser the sum of $10,000 as liquidated damages and not as
a penalty, Seller waiving all other rights or remedies in the event of (i.e., in connection with) such
default by Purchaser. The parties acknowledge that Seller’s actual damages in the event of a
default by Purchaser under this Agreement will be difficult to ascertain, and that such liquidated
damages represent the parties’ best estimate of such damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any right of Seller to liquidated damages shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any indemnity
obligation, liability or duty of Purchaser and such other obligations, liabilities and duties as are
provided and/or referenced herein.

                 (b)     Seller’s Default. If this transaction fails to close as a result of Seller’s
default, and such default is not cured by Seller within five (5) business days after receipt of written
notice from Purchaser specifying the nature of the default, then Purchaser, as Purchaser’s sole
and exclusive remedies hereunder, may elect to (i) commence an action for specific performance;
or (ii) terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to Seller; or (iii) waive such default and
proceed to Closing. If Purchaser elects to commence an action for specific performance,
Purchaser must commence any such action within sixty (60) days after the scheduled Closing
Date. If, however, the equitable remedy of specific performance is not available, Purchaser may
seek any other monetary remedy available at law (i.e., the monetary remedy of damages), but
not in equity (i.e., but not any other remedy) for such default by Seller, subject, however, to the
following: In no event shall Seller’s liability exceed (i) $10,000. For purposes of this Section           Deleted: 3,500,000.00
18(b), specific performance shall be considered not available to Purchaser only if a court of              Deleted: ; and (ii) the actual reasonable out-of-pocket
competent jurisdiction declines to grant the remedy of specific performance or if the nature of            expenses incurred by Purchaser and paid to unrelated or
                                                                                                           unaffiliated third party consultants in connection with this
Seller’s default is such that, upon obtaining specific performance, Purchaser will receive materially      Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereunder
less than Purchaser bargained for in this Agreement. If Purchaser elects to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section (b), then the (i) Earnest Money shall be returned to Purchaser.         Deleted: ; and (ii) Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for all of

this transaction. If any claim is made for broker’s or finder’s fees or commissions in connection
with the negotiation, execution or consummation of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby by or through acts of Seller or Purchaser or their respective partners, agents
or affiliates, then Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
the other party from and against any such claim based upon any statement, representation or

       21.     Destruction of Improvements and Condemnation.

               (a)     If, prior to Closing, (i) any of the improvements on the Premises are
damaged or destroyed such that the cost of repair or replacement of such improvements is
reasonably likely to exceed Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) (“Material
Damage”), or (ii) any condemnation proceeding is commenced or threatened in writing by a
governmental or quasi-governmental agency with the power of eminent domain
(“Condemnation”), then:

                       (1)     Purchaser may elect, within ten (10) business days from and after
       its receipt of written notice of any Material Damage or written notice of such
       Condemnation, by written notice to Seller, to terminate this Agreement, and if necessary
       the time of Closing shall be extended to permit such election. In the event of an election
       to terminate, the Earnest Money shall be immediately returned to Purchaser and neither
       party shall have any liability to the other by reason hereof, including, without limitation, the
       obligation to incur any additional costs or expenses contemplated under this Agreement,
       and any other provision of this Agreement that is expressly intended to survive the
       termination of this Agreement; or




                                                 22
                       (2)    In the event Purchaser does not timely elect to terminate pursuant
       to subsection (a)(1) above, the transaction contemplated hereby shall be closed without a
       reduction in the Purchase Price, and Seller shall assign all of Seller’s right, title and interest
       in any insurance proceeds or Condemnation award to be paid to Seller, to Purchaser in
       connection with such Material Damage or Condemnation, and, in the case of Material
       Damage, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the deductible under Seller’s
       policy of casualty insurance and Seller shall execute and deliver to Purchaser all required
       proofs of loss, assignments of claims and other similar items.

               (b)    If, prior to Closing, any of the improvements on the Property are damaged
or destroyed and such damage is not Material Damage, Purchaser shall remain obligated to close
hereunder with no abatement in the Purchase Price. At Closing, Seller shall assign Seller’s rights
in any insurance proceeds to be paid to Seller in connection with such damage or destruction, to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall receive a credit against the Purchase Price from Seller in an
amount equal to the deductible amount under Seller’s casualty insurance policy and Seller shall
execute and deliver to Purchaser all required proofs of loss, assignments of claims and other
similar items.

       22.     General Provisions.

              (a)     Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all exhibits and schedules
attached hereto and documents to be delivered pursuant hereto, shall constitute the entire
agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein,
and there are no other prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements, undertakings,
promises, warranties, or covenants related to such subject matter not contained herein.

                 (b)    Amendments in Writing. This Agreement may be amended only by a
written agreement executed by all of the parties hereto. Purchaser and Seller agree that any
amendments or modifications to this Agreement may be entered into by either Purchaser or its
counsel or Seller or its counsel (including without limitation, amendments or modifications related
to title and survey matters) and the execution of an amendment or modification by counsel instead
of the applicable Purchaser or Seller is expressly permitted and agreed to by the parties to this
Agreement and each party’s counsel shall be deemed a permitted and authorized agent of such
party until the time that Purchaser or Seller notifies the other party in writing that their respective
counsel does not have authority to amend or modify this Agreement on its behalf.

               (c)     Waiver. No waiver of any provision or condition of this Agreement by any
party shall be valid unless in writing signed by such party. No such waiver shall be taken as a
waiver of any other or similar provision or of any future event, act, or default.

               (d)    Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence of this Agreement. However,
if Purchaser is acting diligently and in good faith to proceed with the consummation of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date, Seller will, upon the written
request of Purchaser, extend the Closing Date, one time only, up to five (5) days. If any date or
time period provided for in this Agreement or by law falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday
when banks are not open for business in Fulton County, Georgia, then such date or time period
shall then be deemed to refer to the next day which is not the last to occur of: (1) a Saturday or
Sunday, or (2) any one or more of a legal holiday, governmental shutdown or order, or any
reasonable equivalent exists when banks are not open for business in any one or more of such
locations. Further and for the avoidance of doubt, when any date is calculated “from” or “within”



                                                  23
a specific date, the first day after such specific date shall be deemed for all purposes the first day
for purposes of computing the applicable date or time period.

                 (e)     Severability. Except as otherwise provided in the succeeding sentence,
every term and provision of this Agreement is intended to be severable, and if any term or
provision of this Agreement is illegal or invalid for any reason whatsoever, such illegality or
invalidity shall not affect the legality or validity of the remainder of this Agreement. The preceding
sentence shall be of no force or effect if the consequence of enforcing the remainder of this
Agreement without such illegal or invalid term or provision would be to cause any party to lose
the benefit of its economic bargain.

               (f)    Headings. Headings of sections are for convenience of reference only, and
shall not be construed as a part of this Agreement.

                (g)     Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefits of the parties hereto, and their respective successors, and permitted assigns.
This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other
party, provided that this Agreement may be assigned by Purchaser to an affiliate in which Jeff
Altschuler or Scott Altschuler, or an affiliate of either, has an interest, provided that, such
assignment shall not release Purchaser from its obligations under this Agreement.

                 (h)    Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be an adequate and sufficient notice if given in writing
and delivery is made either by (i) personal delivery, in which case the notice shall be deemed
received the date of such personal delivery or refusal of receipt, (ii) nationally recognized
overnight air courier service, next day delivery, prepaid, in which case the notice shall be deemed
to have been received one (1) business day following delivery to such nationally recognized
overnight air courier service or refusal of receipt, (iii) intentionally deleted, or (iv) email, provided
that delivery thereof is acknowledged by the receiving party, evidenced by the sender’s receipt of
a receipt evidencing delivery from its email program, or the sender of an email notice otherwise

recipient, and to the following addresses, facsimile numbers or email addresses, as applicable:

internal laws of the State of Georgia.

                (j)    Counterparts; Non-Paper Records. This Agreement may be signed or
otherwise authenticated in any number of counterparts and by different parties to this Agreement
on separate counterparts, each of which, when so authenticated, shall be deemed an original, but
all such counterparts shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Any signature or other
authentication delivered by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be deemed to be an original
signature hereto. Each party who signs or otherwise authenticates this Agreement hereby: (1)
agrees that the other party may create a duplicate of this Agreement by storing an image of it in
an electronic or other medium (a “Non-Paper Record”); (2) agrees that, after creating the Non-
Paper Record, such party may discard or destroy the original in reliance on this Section; (3)

                (k)    Attorney’s Fees. In the event of any action or proceeding brought by either
party against the other under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all
reasonable costs and expenses including its attorneys’ fees from the non-prevailing party in such
action or proceeding in such amount as the court may adjudge reasonable. The prevailing party
shall be determined by the court based upon an assessment of which party’s major arguments
made or positions taken in the proceedings could fairly be said to have prevailed over the other
party’s major arguments or positions on major disputed issues in the court’s decision. If the party
which shall have commenced or instituted the action, suit or proceeding shall dismiss or
discontinue it without the concurrence of the other party, such other party shall be deemed the
prevailing party.

                (l)     Construction. This Agreement shall not be construed more strictly against

neuter gender shall be deemed to include the masculine, feminine and neuter genders and any
word herein which is expressed in the singular or plural shall be deemed, whenever appropriate

              (m)    Reporting Obligations. Seller and Purchaser hereby designate Title Insurer

transaction contemplated by this Agreement for purposes of 26 C.F.R. Section 1.6045-4(e)(5)
relating to the requirements for information reporting on real estate transaction closed on or after

Property as a like-kind exchange under Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 at such party’s sole
cost and expense. The other party shall reasonably cooperate therein, provided that such party
shall incur no costs, expenses or liabilities in connection with such party’s exchange and the other
party shall not be required to take title to or contract for purchase of any other property. If either
party uses a qualified intermediary to effectuate the exchange, any assignment of the rights or
obligations of such party hereunder shall not relieve, release or absolve such party of its
obligations to the other party hereunder.

                (o)      Confidentiality/Exclusivity. (i) Purchaser and its respective representatives
shall hold in strictest confidence all data and information obtained with respect to the operation

and its respective representatives shall hold in strictest confidence all data and information
obtained with respect to Purchaser and its affiliates’ operations and the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, whether obtained before or after the execution and delivery hereof, and shall not
use such data or information for purposes unrelated to this Agreement or disclose the same to
others except as expressly permitted hereunder. The preceding sentence shall not be construed
to prevent either party from disclosing to: (y) its prospective lenders or investors, or to its officers,
directors, attorneys, accountants, architects, engineers and consultants to perform their
designated tasks in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement; provided
that such disclosing party advises any such third party of the confidential nature of the information
disclosed, or (z) Escrow Agent. However, neither party shall have this obligation concerning
information which: (a) is published or becomes publicly available through no fault of either
Purchaser or Seller; (b) is rightfully received from a third party; or (c) is required to be disclosed
by law. Seller agrees that, at all times during the Due Diligence Period, Seller shall not, directly
or indirectly, through any officer, director, agent, representative or otherwise, market, solicit,
initiate or encourage the making of any inquiries, engage in marketing, negotiations or other
substantial discussions, or enter into any agreement with any party, with respect to the transaction
contemplated under this Agreement and shall discontinue marketing, pending discussions or
negotiations with respect to the transaction contemplated hereunder.

shall include accountants’ fees and costs and attorneys’ fees, costs, and disbursements, including
fees for the services of paralegals, legal assistants. And similar persons, whether or not litigation
or administrative proceedings are commenced. If litigation or administrative proceedings are
commenced, such term shall include all fees, costs, and disbursements through the trial or other
initial proceeding and through all appellate levels, as well as all other fees, costs. And
disbursements relayed to such litigation or administrative proceedings, including, without
limitations, the enforcement of any judgments.

hold harmless Purchaser, its shareholders, directors, employees, other agents, successors, and
assigns, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, actions, fines, liabilities, Fees and
Costs, and all other expenses related to, growing out of, or arising from:



                                                   26
                       (1)    Seller's failure to pay sales tax due to the State of Georgia on any
       rentals or sales before the Closing;

                     (2)    Seller's failure to pay any personal property taxes against the
       Tangible Personal Property for calendar years before the Closing;

                      (3)      Seller's handling of any tenant security deposits received by Seller
       before the Closing;

                     (4)    any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in
       this Agreement ; and

                       (5)     Any breach by Seller of any term or condition contained herein.

The provisions of this Section shall survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement.

              (q)     Waiver of Trial by Jury. Each of Seller and Purchaser hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives trial by jury in any action, proceeding or
counterclaim brought by such party against the other party on any matters whatsoever
arising out of or in any way connected with this Agreement, including, without limitation,
in connection with the enforcement of any remedy under any statute, emergency or
otherwise.

              (r)     Exhibits. All exhibits attached hereto are incorporated herein by reference
to the same extent as though such exhibits were included in the body of this Agreement verbatim.

               (s)    No Recording. Neither this Agreement nor any memorandum notice or
short form hereof shall be recorded.

              (t)    Venue. Venue for any action brought relative to this Agreement shall be in
Fulton County, Georgia.

              (u)     Further Assurances. Each of the parties to this Agreement, without further
consideration but at no material cost or expense to either party, shall execute and deliver such
other documents, and take such other action, whether prior or subsequent to the Closing, as may
be reasonably necessary to more effectively consummate the purposes or subject matter of this
Agreement.

          (v)   PROPERTY TAX DISCLOSURE SUMMARY. PURCHASER SHOULD
NOT RELY ON THE SELLER’S CURRENT PROPERTY TAXES AS THE AMOUNT OF
PROPERTY TAXES THAT THE PURCHASER MAY BE OBLIGATED TO PAY IN THE YEAR
SUBSEQUENT TO CLOSING. CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS
TRIGGERS REASSESSMENTS OF THE PROPERTY THAT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER
PROPERTY TAXES. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CONCERNING VALUATION, CONTACT
THE COUNTY PROPERTY APPRAISER’S OFFICE FOR INFORMATION.

       24.     Right of First Refusal Clarification.

               (a)     Upon execution of this Agreement, and as independent consideration for
Seller entering into this Agreement, the existing lease between Seller and Purchaser/Tenant is
hereby amended to provide that if Tenant exercises its right of first refusal to match any third-party


                                                 27
offer, Tenant's matching price shall be increased by the difference between (i) any brokerage
commission that would be payable by Seller if Tenant purchases the Property (currently 6%) and
(ii) any brokerage commission that would be payable by Seller to sell to such third party, ensuring
Seller receives equivalent net proceeds regardless of purchaser.

                (b)    This Section 24 and the lease modification described herein shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of whether
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement closes. The parties acknowledge this modification
constitutes a separate agreement supported by independent consideration and is not contingent
upon the closing of the sale contemplated herein.

       25.     Broker release condition and seller protection.

               (a)    Condition to Closing. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller's obligation to
close is conditioned upon the full execution and effectiveness of that certain Settlement and
