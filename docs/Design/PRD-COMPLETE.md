# Financial Management System - Complete PRD Archive

**Created:** 09/12/25 6:06PM ET  
**Purpose:** Complete original PRD preserved for reference - superseded by modular BUILD-* documentation  
**Status:** ARCHIVED - Use BUILD-* files for implementation

## Archive Notice

This file contains the complete original PRD (1300+ lines) that has been restructured into the following LLM-optimized documentation bundles:

### Active Implementation Documents (Use These):
- **PRD-overview.md** - Executive summary and core architecture (always read first)
- **BUILD-dashboards.md** - Complete dashboard implementation guide
- **BUILD-workflows-documents.md** - Document viewing and search workflows  
- **BUILD-workflows-financial.md** - Cash flow analysis, asset performance, net worth management
- **BUILD-workflows-tax.md** - Tax analysis, payment tracking, YoY comparisons
- **BUILD-workflows-admin.md** - Administrative functions, entity management, system controls

### Why This Was Restructured:
1. **LLM Context Optimization** - Each BUILD file is self-contained with all needed context
2. **Implementation Focus** - Each file targets specific development tasks
3. **Reduced Context Switching** - No need to parse through unrelated sections
4. **Parallel Development** - Multiple developers can work on different BUILD files simultaneously
5. **Maintenance Efficiency** - Updates target specific functional areas

## Migration Notes

### For Development Teams:
1. Start with **PRD-overview.md** for project context
2. Choose relevant **BUILD-*.md** files for your current sprint
3. Each BUILD file contains:
   - LLM Context Summary (task-specific guidance)
   - Complete technical specifications
   - Data source queries
   - Component architectures
   - Implementation guidelines

### For Project Management:
- Use BUILD files to assign work packages
- Each file represents 1-2 weeks of development work
- Dependencies are clearly documented in each file
- Progress can be tracked per BUILD file completion

### For Future Reference:
- This complete PRD remains available for historical context
- All original requirements are preserved in the BUILD files
- New requirements should be added to appropriate BUILD files
- Version control tracks changes at the BUILD file level
