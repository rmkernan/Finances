## üìä Database Schema Overview

### Phase 1 Tables (Currently Implemented)
1. **entities** - Business entities and individual taxpayers
2. **institutions** - Financial institutions (Fidelity, banks, etc.)
3. **accounts** - Individual accounts within institutions
4. **documents** - Financial documents with MD5 hash duplicate prevention
5. **document_accounts** - Links documents to multiple accounts (ESSENTIAL for consolidated statements)
6. **transactions** - Individual financial transactions
7. **positions** - Point-in-time holdings snapshots
8. **doc_level_data** - Document-level summary data transcribed directly from PDFs
9. **map_rules** - User-defined classification rules for transaction categorization
10. **map_conditions** - Trigger conditions for classification rules (IF logic)
11. **map_actions** - Actions taken when rules match (SET logic)
12. **data_mappings** - Legacy single-table mapping system (to be replaced)

## üõ°Ô∏è Schema Design Defense

### Why `document_accounts` Junction Table is Essential

**Real-world requirement:** Fidelity consolidated statements cover multiple accounts in one PDF
- Example: `Fidelity_2025-08_Brok+CMA.pdf` contains both brokerage (Z40-394067) and IRA (Z27-375656) accounts
- One document ‚Üí Multiple accounts ‚Üí Multiple entities (through account ownership)

**Alternative approaches that fail:**
- **Add account_id to documents:** Can't handle consolidated statements covering multiple accounts
- **Use PostgreSQL arrays:** Breaks foreign key constraints and complicates queries
- **Infer from transactions:** Circular dependency during data loading + can't represent empty sections

**Required query patterns:**
```sql
-- Find all accounts in a document
SELECT a.* FROM accounts a
JOIN document_accounts da ON a.id = da.account_id
WHERE da.document_id = 'doc-uuid'

-- Find all documents for an account
SELECT d.* FROM documents d
JOIN document_accounts da ON d.id = da.document_id
WHERE da.account_id = 'account-uuid'
```

### Core Entity Hierarchy Justification

**documents table design:**
- **NO account_id column** - Documents can span multiple accounts
- **institution_id only** - Documents are issued by exactly one institution
- **doc_md5_hash UNIQUE** - Prevents duplicate document processing

**Relationship flow:**
```
Document (PDF) ‚Üí Institution ‚Üí Multiple Accounts ‚Üí Multiple Entities
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì                 ‚Üì
  documents    institutions    accounts         entities
     ‚Üì
document_accounts (junction table)
     ‚Üì
transactions + positions (actual financial data)
```

### Phase 2 Tables (Future Implementation)
- **tax_payments** - Quarterly estimated tax tracking
- **transfers** - Inter-entity money movements
- **asset_notes** - Investment strategy notes
- **real_assets** - Properties and physical assets
- **liabilities** - Mortgages and loans

## üîë Key Design Principles

### 1. Duplicate Prevention & Incremental Loading Strategy
- **Stage 1:** MD5 hash generated during document staging (`md5sum` command)
- **Stage 2:** Database UNIQUE constraint on `doc_md5_hash` column (PDF level)
- **Stage 3:** Incremental loading support with JSON hash tracking in documents table:
  - `activities_loaded` timestamp + `activities_json_md5_hash` for activities JSON
  - `positions_loaded` timestamp + `positions_json_md5_hash` for positions JSON
  - Enables loading activities first, then positions later (or vice versa)
- **Stage 4:** JSON content hash in `json_output_md5_hash` columns in transactions/positions tables
- **Stage 5:** Source file tracking in `source_file` columns for audit trail
- **Important:** Using MD5, NOT SHA-256 for hashing
- **Key Design:** Same PDF can load both activities and positions incrementally with duplicate prevention

### 2. Multi-Entity Architecture
- One document can reference multiple accounts (consolidated statements)
- Each account belongs to exactly one entity
- Entities can have accounts at multiple institutions

### 3. Soft Delete Pattern
- `is_archived` columns on documents and transactions
- Records are never deleted, only archived
- Use `WHERE is_archived = FALSE` in normal queries


## üìù PostgreSQL Comments

The database is self-documenting with embedded comments:

```sql
-- View table comments
SELECT obj_description('tablename'::regclass);

-- View column comments
SELECT col_description('tablename'::regclass, ordinal_position)
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'tablename';

-- In psql, use \d+ to see comments
\d+ documents
```

### Critical Comments to Know
- `doc_md5_hash`: "MD5 hash (NOT SHA-256) for PDF duplicate detection"
- `source_file`: "JSON filename that created this transaction/position record"
- `doc_level_data` table: "Transcribed summary data from PDF documents - NOT derived/calculated"
- `document_accounts` table: "Essential junction table for consolidated statements covering multiple accounts"
- `account_number`: "Should be encrypted/masked in production"
- `is_archived`: "Soft delete flag - true means hidden from normal queries"

## üó∫Ô∏è Configuration-Driven Transaction Classification

### Three-Table Mapping System

**Updated:** 09/25/25 10:30PM - SIMPLIFIED to 2-level rule structure: Transaction Classification (Level 1) and Security Classification (Level 2). Fixed Return Of Capital case sensitivity issue.

The system uses a flexible, user-editable rule-based approach for automatic transaction classification:

**map_rules** - Master rule definitions
```sql
CREATE TABLE map_rules (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    rule_name text NOT NULL,                    -- "Muni Bond Interest", "Opening Options Transaction"
    application_order integer NOT NULL,         -- Processing order (1=first)
    rule_category text NOT NULL,               -- "Options Lifecycle", "Transaction Types"
    problem_solved text,                        -- Business justification for rule
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

**map_conditions** - Rule trigger conditions (IF logic)
```sql
CREATE TABLE map_conditions (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    rule_id uuid REFERENCES map_rules(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    check_field text NOT NULL,                  -- "activities.description", "activities.section"
    match_operator text NOT NULL,              -- "contains", "equals", "starts_with"
    match_value text NOT NULL,                 -- "Muni Exempt Int", "dividends_interest_income"
    logic_connector text DEFAULT 'AND'         -- "AND", "OR" for multiple conditions
);
```

**map_actions** - Rule outcomes (SET logic)
```sql
CREATE TABLE map_actions (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    rule_id uuid REFERENCES map_rules(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    set_field text NOT NULL,                   -- "activities.type", "activities.subtype"
    set_value text NOT NULL                    -- "interest", "muni_exempt", "call"
);
```

### Human-Readable View

The system includes a view that formats rules in business-friendly IF-THEN format:

```sql
CREATE VIEW mapping_rules_readable AS
SELECT
    r.rule_name,
    STRING_AGG(
        c.check_field || ' ' || c.match_operator || ' "' || c.match_value || '"',
        ' ' || c.logic_connector || ' '
        ORDER BY c.id
    ) as triggers,
    STRING_AGG(
        'SET ' || a.set_field || ' = "' || a.set_value || '"',
        '; '
        ORDER BY a.id
    ) as actions,
    r.problem_solved
FROM map_rules r
LEFT JOIN map_conditions c ON r.id = c.rule_id
LEFT JOIN map_actions a ON r.id = a.rule_id
GROUP BY r.id, r.rule_name, r.problem_solved
ORDER BY r.application_order;
```

### CSV Rule Management Workflow

**User-Friendly Rule Editing:**
1. **CSV File:** `/config/mapping-rules.csv` - Human-readable format with columns:
   - Rule Name, Triggers, Actions, Problem Solved
2. **Excel Integration:** User opens CSV in Excel for visual editing with formatting
3. **Bulk Updates:** User saves changes, Claude reads CSV and updates database tables
4. **Real-time Application:** Updated rules immediately apply to new transaction processing

**Example CSV Format:**
```csv
Rule Name,Triggers,Actions,Problem Solved
"Muni Bond Interest","activities.description contains ""Muni Exempt Int"" AND activities.section equals ""dividends_interest_income""","SET activities.type = ""interest""; SET activities.subtype = ""muni_exempt""","Municipal bonds in dividend section were taxed as dividends instead of tax-free interest"
```

### Rule Processing Logic

**CRITICAL:** Rules are applied strictly by `application_order`, NOT by category. Categories are only for human organization.

**SIMPLIFIED 2-LEVEL STRUCTURE** (as of 09/25/25):

**Level 1: Transaction Classification** (application_order = 1)
- 18 rules that determine the primary transaction type and subtypes
- Includes: Options transactions, dividends, interest, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, core fund activity
- These rules set `transaction_type`, `transaction_subtype`, and sometimes `sec_class`
- **Foundation rules** - won't be overwritten by Level 2

**Level 2: Security Classification** (application_order = 2)
- 10 rules that identify security types for investment analysis
- Includes: Stock, Bond, ETF, Mutual Fund, REIT, Warrant, Options identification
- These rules primarily set `sec_class` as a fallback when Level 1 doesn't specify it
- **Fallback rules** - only apply if Level 1 didn't already classify the security

**Key Improvements in Simplified Structure:**
- Eliminated unnecessary complexity of 6 application levels
- Clear separation between transaction logic vs security classification
- Level 1 rules are foundational and won't be overwritten
- Level 2 provides security analysis without disrupting transaction classification
- Fixed "Return Of Capital" case sensitivity issue (now matches "Return Of Capital" not "Return of Capital")

**Key Benefits:**
- **No code changes** needed to add new transaction patterns
- **User-controlled** classification rules via Excel interface
- **Consistent results** across all transaction processing
- **Audit trail** with business justification for each rule
- **Cross-table capability** ready for future `positions.security_type` triggers

## üîç Common Database Queries

### Rule Management Queries

```sql
-- View all mapping rules in readable format
SELECT * FROM mapping_rules_readable ORDER BY rule_name;

-- Find rules that modify a specific field
SELECT r.rule_name, a.set_field, a.set_value
FROM map_rules r
JOIN map_actions a ON r.id = a.rule_id
WHERE a.set_field = 'activities.type';

-- Find rules triggered by specific descriptions
SELECT r.rule_name, c.match_value, a.set_field, a.set_value
FROM map_rules r
JOIN map_conditions c ON r.id = c.rule_id
JOIN map_actions a ON r.id = a.rule_id
WHERE c.match_value ILIKE '%muni%';

-- Test what rules would trigger for a sample transaction
-- (Useful for debugging classification issues)
```

### Incremental Loading Status Queries

```sql
-- Check loading status for all documents
SELECT
    file_name,
    activities_loaded IS NOT NULL as has_activities,
    positions_loaded IS NOT NULL as has_positions,
    activities_loaded,
    positions_loaded
FROM documents
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Find documents ready for positions loading (activities already loaded)
SELECT file_name, activities_loaded, doc_md5_hash
FROM documents
WHERE activities_loaded IS NOT NULL
AND positions_loaded IS NULL;

-- Find documents ready for activities loading (positions already loaded)
SELECT file_name, positions_loaded, doc_md5_hash
FROM documents
WHERE positions_loaded IS NOT NULL
AND activities_loaded IS NULL;

-- Check for JSON hash conflicts (same JSON loaded multiple times)
SELECT file_name, activities_json_md5_hash, COUNT(*)
FROM documents
WHERE activities_json_md5_hash IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY file_name, activities_json_md5_hash
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Check for Duplicate Documents
```sql
-- Check PDF document hash
SELECT id, file_name, period_start, period_end,
       activities_loaded, positions_loaded
FROM documents
WHERE doc_md5_hash = 'your_pdf_hash_here';

-- Check if activities already loaded for this document
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions t
JOIN documents d ON t.document_id = d.id
WHERE d.activities_json_md5_hash = 'your_json_hash_here';

-- Check if holdings already loaded for this document
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM positions p
JOIN documents d ON p.document_id = d.id
WHERE d.positions_json_md5_hash = 'your_json_hash_here';

-- Check by filename for audit trail
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions WHERE source_file = 'activities.json';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM positions WHERE source_file = 'holdings.json';
```

### Find All Accounts for an Entity
```sql
SELECT a.*, i.institution_name
FROM accounts a
JOIN institutions i ON a.institution_id = i.id
WHERE a.entity_id = 'entity_uuid_here'
AND a.account_status = 'active';
```

### Get Non-Archived Transactions
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE account_id = 'account_uuid_here'
AND is_archived = FALSE
ORDER BY transaction_date DESC;
```

### View Georgia Tax-Exempt Bonds
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE security_type = 'bond'
AND bond_state = 'GA'
AND federal_taxable = FALSE;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints

### UNIQUE Constraints (Prevent Duplicates)
- `documents.doc_md5_hash` - No duplicate document uploads
- `accounts.(institution_id, account_number)` - No duplicate accounts
- `positions.(document_id, account_id, position_date, sec_ticker, cusip)` - No duplicate positions
- `doc_level_data.(document_id, account_id, doc_section)` - No duplicate summaries

### Foreign Key Rules
- **CASCADE:** Deleting a document deletes its transactions and positions
- **RESTRICT:** Can't delete entities, institutions, or accounts with dependent records
- **SET NULL:** Amendment links cleared if original document deleted

## üéØ Common Tasks




## üìä Database Statistics

### Quick Health Check
```sql
-- Document processing status
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN processed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 'Processed'
        ELSE 'Pending'
    END as status,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM documents
GROUP BY status;

-- Transactions by type
SELECT transaction_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM transactions
WHERE is_archived = FALSE
GROUP BY transaction_type
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Active accounts by institution
SELECT i.institution_name, COUNT(a.*) as account_count
FROM institutions i
LEFT JOIN accounts a ON i.id = a.institution_id
WHERE a.account_status = 'active'
GROUP BY i.institution_name;
```

## üéØ Common Tasks

### Database Backup
Use the `/backup-database` command - provides timestamped backups with data-only, schema-only, and full backup options.

### Reset Database (Development Only)
```bash
supabase db reset  # WARNING: Drops all data
```

## üö® Critical Reminders

- **LOCAL ONLY** - Localhost:54322 Supabase instance only
- **MD5 for hashing** - Use MD5, not SHA-256
- **Soft deletes only** - Use `is_archived = TRUE`, never hard DELETE
- **Check duplicates first** - Always verify MD5 hash before inserting documents
- **Entity hierarchy:** Entity ‚Üí Institution ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Transaction
