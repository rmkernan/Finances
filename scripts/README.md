# Scripts - Utility Scripts and Automation

**Created:** 09/09/25 6:04PM ET  
**Updated:** 09/09/25 6:04PM ET  
**Purpose:** Directory for utility scripts and automation tools for financial data management

## Directory Purpose

This directory is reserved for utility scripts that support the financial data management system. Scripts will be added as operational needs are identified during development and deployment.

## Planned Script Categories

### Database Management Scripts
```bash
# Database setup and initialization
setup_database.sh           # Initial Supabase Docker setup
migrate_schema.sql           # Schema updates and migrations  
backup_database.sh           # Automated backup procedures
restore_database.sh          # Database recovery procedures
```

### File Management Automation
```bash
# Document processing automation
monitor_inbox.sh             # Watch inbox folder for new documents
archive_old_files.sh         # Move processed files to archive
cleanup_temp_files.sh        # Clean temporary processing files
validate_file_integrity.sh   # Check file checksums and integrity
```

### Data Processing Utilities
```bash  
# Data validation and quality assurance
validate_tax_classifications.py    # Check tax treatment consistency
reconcile_cross_sources.py        # Automated reconciliation checks
generate_monthly_reports.py       # Standard report generation
export_tax_summaries.py           # Tax preparation data exports
```

### System Maintenance
```bash
# Infrastructure and monitoring
check_system_health.sh       # Database and service monitoring
update_security_patches.sh   # System security maintenance
monitor_disk_space.sh        # Storage utilization alerts
backup_configuration.sh      # Config and documentation backups
```

## Script Development Guidelines

### Standards and Conventions
```markdown
File Naming:
- Use descriptive names with underscores
- Include file extension (.sh, .py, .sql)
- Prefix with category for organization

Documentation Requirements:
- Header comment with purpose and usage
- Parameter descriptions and examples
- Error handling and exit codes
- Dependencies and requirements

Security Considerations:
- No hardcoded passwords or sensitive data
- Proper file permissions (executable for owner only)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
```

### Example Script Template
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script Name: example_script.sh
# Purpose: Brief description of what the script does
# Usage: ./example_script.sh [parameters]
# Created: MM/DD/YY
# Updated: MM/DD/YY - Description of changes

set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures

# Configuration
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
PROJECT_DIR="$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")"
LOG_FILE="$PROJECT_DIR/logs/$(basename "$0" .sh).log"

# Function definitions
log_message() {
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Main script logic here
main() {
    log_message "Starting script execution"
    # Implementation
    log_message "Script completed successfully"
}

# Error handling
trap 'log_message "Script failed with error on line $LINENO"' ERR

# Execute main function
main "$@"
```

## Integration with Project Workflow

### Command Template Integration
Scripts in this directory will support the command templates in `/commands/`:
- **Document Processing:** Automated file monitoring and initial classification
- **Reconciliation:** Scheduled cross-source validation checks
- **Report Generation:** Automated QBO and summary report creation

### Configuration Integration
Scripts will reference configuration files in `/config/`:
- **Database connections:** From Supabase configuration
- **Account mappings:** From QuickBooks integration settings
- **Tax rules:** From tax classification configuration

### Logging and Monitoring
```markdown
Log Management:
- All scripts log to /logs/ directory (to be created)
- Standard log format: timestamp - message
- Error logs include stack traces and context
- Weekly log rotation and cleanup

Monitoring Integration:
- Health check scripts for system monitoring
- Performance metrics for optimization
- Alert scripts for operational issues
- Dashboard integration for status visibility
```

## Future Script Development

### Phase 1: Core Operations (Development Priority)
```markdown
Immediate Needs:
- Database setup automation for Mac Mini deployment
- File monitoring for document inbox processing
- Backup automation for data protection
- Basic system health checks

Implementation Timeline: During Phase 1 development
```

### Phase 2: Process Automation (Operational Priority)
```markdown
Operational Efficiency:
- Automated document processing workflows
- Scheduled reconciliation reporting
- QBO generation and validation
- Data quality monitoring

Implementation Timeline: During Phase 2-3 development  
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Automation (Optimization Priority)
```markdown
Advanced Features:
- Machine learning for document classification
- Predictive analytics for tax optimization
- Automated anomaly detection
- Integration with external services

Implementation Timeline: Phase 4+ based on operational needs
```

## Development and Testing

### Script Testing Framework
```markdown
Testing Approach:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests with sample data
- End-to-end testing in development environment
- Production validation with monitoring

Test Data:
- Use anonymized sample documents
- Create test database with known data patterns
- Validate against expected outcomes
- Document test cases and edge conditions
```

### Version Control and Deployment
```markdown
Development Process:
- All scripts committed to version control
- Code review for financial data operations
- Staged deployment (dev → staging → production)
- Rollback procedures for failed deployments

Deployment Standards:
- Automated deployment through configuration management
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Health checks post-deployment
- Documentation updates with each release
```

## Operations and Maintenance

### Scheduled Operations
```markdown
Daily:
- Document inbox monitoring
- Database health checks
- Backup validation
- Log file review

Weekly:
- Reconciliation report generation
- System performance analysis
- Security update checks
- File cleanup and archiving

Monthly:
- Comprehensive data validation
- Performance optimization review
- Script effectiveness analysis
- Documentation updates
```

### Error Recovery Procedures
```markdown
Script Failure Response:
1. Immediate notification via logging system
2. Automatic rollback to last known good state
3. Manual investigation of failure cause
4. Fix implementation and testing
5. Redeployment with enhanced monitoring

Common Issues:
- Database connection failures
- File permission problems
- Disk space limitations
- Network connectivity issues
```
